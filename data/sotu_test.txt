president lyndon b. johnson 's annual message to the congress on the state of the union
november 27 , 1963
mr. speaker , mr. president , members of the house , members of the senate , my fellow americans : all i have i would have given gladly not to be standing here today .
the greatest leader of our time has been struck down by the foulest deed of our time .
today john fitzgerald kennedy lives on in the immortal words and works that he left behind .
he lives on in the mind and memories of mankind .
he lives on in the hearts of his countrymen .
no words are sad enough to express our sense of loss .
no words are strong enough to express our determination to continue the forward thrust of america that he began .
the dream of conquering the vastness of space -- the dream of partnership across the atlantic -- and across the pacific as well -- the dream of a peace corps in less developed nations -- the dream of education for all of our children -- the dream of jobs for all who seek them and need them -- the dream of care for our elderly -- the dream of an all - out attack on mental illness -- and above all , the dream of equal rights for all americans , whatever their race or color -- these and other american dreams have been vitalized by his drive and by his dedication .
and now the ideas and the ideals which he so nobly represented must and will be translated into effective action .
under john kennedy 's leadership , this nation has demonstrated that it has the courage to seek peace , and it has the fortitude to risk war .
we have proved that we are a good and reliable friend to those who seek peace and freedom .
we have shown that we can also be a formidable foe to those who reject the path of peace and those who seek to impose upon us or our allies the yoke of tyranny .
this nation will keep its commitments from south viet - nam to west berlin .
we will be unceasing in the search for peace ; resourceful in our pursuit of areas of agreement even with those with whom we differ ; and generous and loyal to those who join with us in common cause .
in this age when there can be no losers in peace and no victors in war , we must recognize the obligation to match national strength with national restraint .
we must be prepared at one and the same time for both the confrontation of power and the limitation of power .
we must be ready to defend the national interest and to negotiate the common interest .
this is the path that we shall continue to pursue .
those who test our courage will find it strong , and those who seek our friendship will find it honorable .
we will demonstrate anew that the strong can be just in the use of strength ; and the just can be strong in the defense of justice .
and let all know we will extend no special privilege and impose no persecution .
we will carry on the fight against poverty and misery , and disease and ignorance , in other lands and in our own .
we will serve all the nation , not one section or one sector , or one group , but all americans .
these are the united states -- a united people with a united purpose .
our american unity does not depend upon unanimity .
we have differences ; but now , as in the past , we can derive from those differences strength , not weakness , wisdom , not despair .
both as a people and a government , we can unite upon a program , a program which is wise and just , enlightened and constructive .
for 32 years capitol hill has been my home .
i have shared many moments of pride with you , pride in the ability of the congress of the united states to act , to meet any crisis , to distill from our differences strong programs of national action .
an assassin 's bullet has thrust upon me the awesome burden of the presidency .
i am here today to say i need your help ; i cannot bear this burden alone .
i need the help of all americans , and all america .
this nation has experienced a profound shock , and in this critical moment , it is our duty , yours and mine , as the government of the united states , to do away with uncertainty and doubt and delay , and to show that we are capable of decisive action ; that from the brutal loss of our leader we will derive not weakness , but strength ; that we can and will act and act now .
from this chamber of representative government , let all the world know and none misunderstand that i rededicate this government to the unswerving support of the united nations , to the honorable and determined execution of our commitments to our allies , to the maintenance of military strength second to none , to the defense of the strength and the stability of the dollar , to the expansion of our foreign trade , to the reinforcement of our programs of mutual assistance and cooperation in asia and africa , and to our alliance for progress in this hemisphere .
on the 20th day of january , in 1961 , john f. kennedy told his countrymen that our national work would not be finished `` in the first thousand days , nor in the life of this administration , nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet .
but , '' he said , `` let us begin .
`` today , in this moment of new resolve , i would say to all my fellow americans , let us continue .
this is our challenge -- not to hesitate , not to pause , not to turn about and linger over this evil moment , but to continue on our course so that we may fulfill the destiny that history has set for us .
our most immediate tasks are here on this hill .
first , no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor president kennedy 's memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long .
we have talked long enough in this country about equal rights .
we have talked for one hundred years or more .
it is time now to write the next chapter , and to write it in the books of law .
i urge you again , as i did in 1957 and again in 1960 , to enact a civil rights law so that we can move forward to eliminate from this nation every trace of discrimination and oppression that is based upon race or color .
there could be no greater source of strength to this nation both at home and abroad .
and second , no act of ours could more fittingly continue the work of president kennedy than the early passage of the tax bill for which he fought all this long year .
this is a bill designed to increase our national income and federal revenues , and to provide insurance against recession .
that bill , if passed without delay , means more security for those now working , more jobs for those now without them , and more incentive for our economy .
in short , this is no time for delay .
it is a time for action -- strong , forward - looking action on the pending education bills to help bring the light of learning to every home and hamlet in america -- strong , forward - looking action on youth employment opportunities ; strong , forward - looking action on the pending foreign aid bill , making clear that we are not forfeiting our responsibilities to this hemisphere or to the world , nor erasing executive flexibility in the conduct of our foreign affairs -- and strong , prompt , and forward - looking action on the remaining appropriation bills .
in this new spirit of action , the congress can expect the full cooperation and support of the executive branch .
and in particular , i pledge that the expenditures of your government will be administered with the utmost thrift and frugality .
i will insist that the government get a dollar 's value for a dollar spent .
the government will set an example of prudence and economy .
this does not mean that we will not meet our unfilled needs or that we will not honor our commitments .
we will do both .
as one who has long served in both houses of the congress , i firmly believe in the independence and the integrity of the legislative branch .
and i promise you that i shall always respect this .
it is deep in the marrow of my bones .
with equal firmness , i believe in the capacity and i believe in the ability of the congress , despite the divisions of opinions which characterize our nation , to act -- to act wisely , to act vigorously , to act speedily when the need arises .
the need is here .
the need is now .
i ask your help .
we meet in grief , but let us also meet in renewed dedication and renewed vigor .
let us meet in action , in tolerance , and in mutual understanding .
john kennedy 's death commands what his life conveyed -- that america must move forward .
the time has come for americans of all races and creeds and political beliefs to understand and to respect one another .
so let us put an end to the teaching and the preaching of hate and evil and violence .
let us turn away from the fanatics of the far left and the far right , from the apostles of bitterness and bigotry , from those defiant of law , and those who pour venom into our nation 's bloodstream .
i profoundly hope that the tragedy and the torment of these terrible days will bind us together in new fellowship , making us one people in our hour of sorrow .
so let us here highly resolve that john fitzgerald kennedy did not live -- or die -- in vain .
and on this thanksgiving eve , as we gather together to ask the lord 's blessing , and give him our thanks , let us unite in those familiar and cherished words :
america , america , god shed his grace on thee , and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea .
president john f. kennedy 's annual address to a joint session of congress on the state of the union
i congratulate you all - not merely on your electoral victory but on your selected role in history .
for you and i are privileged to serve the great republic in what could be the most decisive decade in its long history .
the choices we make , for good or ill , may well shape the state of the union for generations yet to come .
little more than 100 weeks ago i assumed the office of president of the united states .
in seeking the help of the congress and our countrymen , i pledged no easy answers .
i pledged - and asked - only toil and dedication .
these the congress and the people have given in good measure .
and today , having witnessed in recent months a heightened respect for our national purpose and power - having seen the courageous calm of a united people in a perilous hour - and having observed a steady improvement in the opportunities and well - being of our citizens - i can report to you that the state of this old but youthful union , in the 175th year of its life , is good .
in the world beyond our borders , steady progress has been made in building a world of order .
the people of west berlin remain both free and secure .
a settlement , though still precarious , has been reached in laos .
the spear point of aggression has been blunted in viet nam .
the end of agony may be in sight in the congo .
the doctrine of troika is dead .
and , while danger continues , a deadly threat has been removed in cuba .
at home , the recession is behind us .
well over a million more men and women are working today than were working 2 years ago .
the average factory workweek is once again more than 40 hours ; our industries are turning out more goods than ever before ; and more than half of the manufacturing capacity that lay silent and wasted 100 weeks ago is humming with activity .
in short , both at home and abroad , there may now be a temptation to relax .
for the road has been long , the burden heavy , and the pace consistently urgent .
but we cannot be satisfied to rest here .
this is the side of the hill , not the top .
the mere absence of war is not peace .
the mere absence of recession is not growth .
we have made a beginning - but we have only begun .
now the time has come to make the most of our gains - to translate the renewal of our national strength into the achievement of our national purpose .
i . america has enjoyed twenty - two months of uninterrupted economic recovery .
but recovery is not enough .
if we are to prevail in the long run , we must expand the long - run strength of our economy .
we must move along the path to a higher rate of growth and full employment .
for this would mean tens of billions of dollars more each year in production , profits , wages , and public revenues .
it would mean an end to the persistent slack which has kept our unemployment at or above 5 percent for 61 out of the past 62 months - and an end to the growing pressures for such restrictive measures as the 35 - hour week , which alone could increase hourly labor costs by as much as 14 percent , start a new wage - price spiral of inflation , and undercut our efforts to compete with other nations .
to achieve these greater gains , one step , above all , is essential - the enactment this year of a substantial reduction and revision in federal income taxes .
for it is increasingly clear - to those in government , business , and labor who are responsible for our economy 's success - that our obsolete tax system exerts too heavy a drag on private purchasing power , profits , and employment .
designed to check inflation in earlier years , it now checks growth instead .
it discourages extra effort and risk .
it distorts the use of resources .
it invites recurrent recessions , depresses our federal revenues , and causes chronic budget deficits .
now , when the inflationary pressures of the war and the post - war years no longer threaten , and the dollar commands new respect - now , when no military crisis strains our resources - now is the time to act .
we cannot afford to be timid or slow .
for this is the most urgent task confronting the congress in 1963 .
in an early message , i shall propose a permanent reduction in tax rates which will lower liabilities by $ 13 . 5 billion .
of this , $ 11 billion results from reducing individual tax rates , which now range between 20 and 91 percent , to a more sensible range of 14 to 65 percent , with a split in the present first bracket .
two and one - half billion dollars results from reducing corporate tax rates , from 52 percent - which gives the government today a majority interest in profits - to the permanent pre - korean level of 47 percent .
this is in addition to the more than $ 2 billion cut in corporate tax liabilities resulting from last year 's investment credit and depreciation reform .
to achieve this reduction within the limits of a manageable budgetary deficit , i urge : first , that these cuts be phased over 3 calendar years , beginning in 1963 with a cut of some $ 6 billion at annual rates ; second , that these reductions be coupled with selected structural changes , beginning in 1964 , which will broaden the tax base , end unfair or unnecessary preferences , remove or lighten certain hardships , and in the net offset some $ 3 . 5 billion of the revenue loss ; and third , that budgetary receipts at the outset be increased by $ 1 . 5 billion a year , without any change in tax liabilities , by gradually shifting the tax payments of large corporations to a more current time schedule .
this combined program , by increasing the amount of our national income , will in time result in still higher federal revenues .
it is a fiscally responsible program - the surest and the soundest way of achieving in time a balanced budget in a balanced full employment economy .
this net reduction in tax liabilities of $ 10 billion will increase the purchasing power of american families and business enterprises in every tax bracket , with greatest increase going to our low - income consumers .
it will , in addition , encourage the initiative and risk - taking on which our free system depends - induce more investment , production , and capacity use - help provide the 2 million new jobs we need every year - and reinforce the american principle of additional reward for additional effort .
i do not say that a measure for tax reduction and reform is the only way to achieve these goals .
no doubt a massive increase in federal spending could also create jobs and growth - but , in today 's setting , private consumers , employers , and investors should be given a full opportunity first .
no doubt a temporary tax cut could provide a spur to our economy - but a long - run problem compels a long - run solution .
no doubt a reduction in either individual or corporation taxes alone would be of great help - but corporations need customers and job seekers need jobs .
no doubt tax reduction without reform would sound simpler and more attractive to many - but our growth is also hampered by a host of tax inequities and special preferences which have distorted the flow of investment .
and , finally , there are no doubt some who would prefer to put off a tax cut in the hope that ultimately an end to the cold war would make possible an equivalent cut in expenditures - but that end is not in view and to wait for it would be costly and self - defeating .
in submitting a tax program which will , of course , temporarily increase the deficit but can ultimately end it - and in recognition of the need to control expenditures - i will shortly submit a fiscal 1964 administrative budget which , while allowing for needed rises in defense , space , and fixed interest charges , holds total expenditures for all other purposes below this year 's level .
this requires the reduction or postponement of many desirable programs , the absorption of a large part of last year 's federal pay raise through personnel and other economies , the termination of certain installations and projects , and the substitution in several programs of private for public credit .
but i am convinced that the enactment this year of tax reduction and tax reform overshadows all other domestic problems in this congress .
for we cannot for long lead the cause of peace and freedom , if we ever cease to set the pace here at home .
ii .
tax reduction alone , however , is not enough to strengthen our society , to provide opportunities for the four million americans who are born every year , to improve the lives of 32 million americans who live on the outskirts of poverty .
the quality of american life must keep pace with the quantity of american goods .
this country cannot afford to be materially rich and spiritually poor .
therefore , by holding down the budgetary cost of existing programs to keep within the limitations i have set , it is both possible and imperative to adopt other new measures that we cannot afford to postpone .
these measures are based on a series of fundamental premises , grouped under four related headings :
first , we need to strengthen our nation by investing in our youth : the future of any country which is dependent upon the will and wisdom of its citizens is damaged , and irreparably damaged , whenever any of its children is not educated to the full extent of his talent , from grade school through graduate school .
today , an estimated 4 out of every 10 students in the 5th grade will not even finish high school - and that is a waste we cannot afford .
in addition , there is no reason why one million young americans , out of school and out of work , should all remain unwanted and often untrained on our city streets when their energies can be put to good use .
finally , the overseas success of our peace corps volunteers , most of them young men and women carrying skills and ideas to needy people , suggests the merit of a similar corps serving our own community needs : in mental hospitals , on indian reservations , in centers for the aged or for young delinquents , in schools for the illiterate or the handicapped .
as the idealism of our youth has served world peace , so can it serve the domestic tranquility .
second , we need to strengthen our nation by safeguarding its health : our working men and women , instead of being forced to beg for help from public charity once they are old and ill , should start contributing now to their own retirement health program through the social security system .
moreover , all our miracles of medical research will count for little if we cannot reverse the growing nationwide shortage of doctors , dentists , and nurses , and the widespread shortages of nursing homes and modern urban hospital facilities .
merely to keep the present ratio of doctors and dentists from declining any further , we must over the next 10 years increase the capacity of our medical schools by 50 percent and our dental schools by 100 percent .
finally , and of deep concern , i believe that the abandonment of the mentally ill and the mentally retarded to the grim mercy of custodial institutions too often inflicts on them and on their families a needless cruelty which this nation should not endure .
the incidence of mental retardation in this country is three times as high as that of sweden , for example - and that figure can and must be reduced .
third , we need to strengthen our nation by protecting the basic rights of its citizens : the right to competent counsel must be assured to every man accused of crime in federal court , regardless of his means .
and the most precious and powerful right in the world , the right to vote in a free american election , must not be denied to any citizen on grounds of his race or color .
i wish that all qualified americans permitted to vote were willing to vote , but surely in this centennial year of emancipation all those who are willing to vote should always be permitted .
fourth , we need to strengthen our nation by making the best and the most economical use of its resources and facilities : our economic health depends on healthy transportation arteries ; and i believe the way to a more modern , economical choice of national transportation service is through increased competition and decreased regulation .
local mass transit , faring even worse , is as essential a community service as hospitals and highways .
nearly three - fourths of our citizens live in urban areas , which occupy only 2 percent of our land - and if local transit is to survive and relieve the congestion of these cities , it needs federal stimulation and assistance .
next , this government is in the storage and stockpile business to the melancholy tune of more than $ 16 billion .
we must continue to support farm income , but we should not pile more farm surpluses on top of the $ 7 . 5 billion we already own .
we must maintain a stockpile of strategic materials , but the $ 8 . 5 billion we have acquired - for reasons both good and bad - is much more than we need ; and we should be empowered to dispose of the excess in ways which will not cause market disruption .
finally , our already overcrowded national parks and recreation areas will have twice as many visitors 10 years from now as they do today .
if we do not plan today for the future growth of these and other great natural assets - not only parks and forests but wildlife and wilderness preserves , and water projects of all kinds - our children and their children will be poorer in every sense of the word .
these are not domestic concerns alone .
for upon our achievement of greater vitality and strength here at home hang our fate and future in the world : our ability to sustain and supply the security of free men and nations , our ability to command their respect for our leadership , our ability to expand our trade without threat to our balance of payments , and our ability to adjust to the changing demands of cold war competition and challenge .
we shall be judged more by what we do at home than by what we preach abroad .
nothing we could do to help the developing countries would help them half as much as a booming u. s . economy .
and nothing our opponents could do to encourage their own ambitions would encourage them half as much as a chronic lagging u. s . economy .
these domestic tasks do not divert energy from our security - they provide the very foundation for freedom 's survival and success .
iii .
turning to the world outside , it was only a few years ago - in southeast asia , africa , eastern europe , latin america , even outer space - that communism sought to convey the image of a unified , confident , and expanding empire , closing in on a sluggish america and a free world in disarray .
but few people would hold to that picture today .
in these past months we have reaffirmed the scientific and military superiority of freedom .
we have doubled our efforts in space , to assure us of being first in the future .
we have undertaken the most far - reaching defense improvements in the peacetime history of this country .
and we have maintained the frontiers of freedom from viet nam to west berlin .
but complacency or self - congratulation can imperil our security as much as the weapons of tyranny .
a moment of pause is not a promise of peace .
dangerous problems remain from cuba to the south china sea .
the world 's prognosis prescribes , in short , not a year 's vacation for us , but a year of obligation and opportunity .
four special avenues of opportunity stand out : the atlantic alliance , the developing nations , the new sino - soviet difficulties , and the search for worldwide peace .
first , how fares the grand alliance ?
free europe is entering into a new phase of its long and brilliant history .
the era of colonial expansion has passed ; the era of national rivalries is fading ; and a new era of interdependence and unity is taking shape .
defying the old prophecies of marx , consenting to what no conqueror could ever compel , the free nations of europe are moving toward a unity of purpose and power and policy in every sphere of activity .
for 17 years this movement has had our consistent support , both political and economic .
far from resenting the new europe , we regard her as a welcome partner , not a rival .
for the road to world peace and freedom is still long , and there are burdens which only full partners can share - in supporting the common defense , in expanding world trade , in aligning our balance of payments , in aiding the emergent nations , in concerting political and economic policies , and in welcoming to our common effort other industrialized nations , notably japan , whose remarkable economic and political development of the 1950 's permits it now to play on the world scene a major constructive role .
no doubt differences of opinion will continue to get more attention than agreements on action , as europe moves from independence to more formal interdependence .
but these are honest differences among honorable associates - more real and frequent , in fact , among our western european allies than between them and the united states .
for the unity of freedom has never relied on uniformity of opinion .
but the basic agreement of this alliance on fundamental issues continues .
the first task of the alliance remains the common defense .
last month prime minister macmillan and i laid plans for a new stage in our long cooperative effort , one which aims to assist in the wider task of framing a common nuclear defense for the whole alliance .
the nassau agreement recognizes that the security of the west is indivisible , and so must be our defense .
but it also recognizes that this is an alliance of proud and sovereign nations , and works best when we do not forget it .
it recognizes further that the nuclear defense of the west is not a matter for the present nuclear powers alone - that france will be such a power in the future - and that ways must be found without increasing the hazards of nuclear diffusion , to increase the role of our other partners in planning , manning , and directing a truly multilateral nuclear force within an increasingly intimate nato alliance .
finally , the nassau agreement recognizes that nuclear defense is not enough , that the agreed nato levels of conventional strength must be met , and that the alliance cannot afford to be in a position of having to answer every threat with nuclear weapons or nothing .
we remain too near the nassau decisions , and too far from their full realization , to know their place in history .
but i believe that , for the first time , the door is open for the nuclear defense of the alliance to become a source of confidence , instead of a cause of contention .
the next most pressing concern of the alliance is our common economic goals of trade and growth .
this nation continues to be concerned about its balance - of - payments deficit , which , despite its decline , remains a stubborn and troublesome problem .
we believe , moreover , that closer economic ties among all free nations are essential to prosperity and peace .
and neither we nor the members of the european common market are so affluent that we can long afford to shelter high cost farms or factories from the winds of foreign competition , or to restrict the channels of trade with other nations of the free world .
if the common market should move toward protectionism and restrictionism , it would undermine its own basic principles .
this government means to use the authority conferred on it last year by the congress to encourage trade expansion on both sides of the atlantic and around the world .
second , what of the developing and non - aligned nations ?
they were shocked by the soviets ' sudden and secret attempt to transform cuba into a nuclear striking base - and by communist china 's arrogant invasion of india .
they have been reassured by our prompt assistance to india , by our support through the united nations of the congo 's unification , by our patient search for disarmament , and by the improvement in our treatment of citizens and visitors whose skins do not happen to be white .
and as the older colonialism recedes , and the neo - colonialism of the communist powers stands out more starkly than ever , they realize more clearly that the issue in the world struggle is not communism versus capitalism , but coercion versus free choice .
they are beginning to realize that the longing for independence is the same the world over , whether it is the independence of west berlin or viet nam .
they are beginning to realize that such independence runs athwart all communist ambitions but is in keeping with our own - and that our approach to their diverse needs is resilient and resourceful , while the communists are still relying on ancient doctrines and dogmas .
nevertheless it is hard for any nation to focus on an external or subversive threat to its independence when its energies are drained in daily combat with the forces of poverty and despair .
it makes little sense for us to assail , in speeches and resolutions , the horrors of communism , to spend $ 50 billion a year to prevent its military advance - and then to begrudge spending , largely on american products , less than one - tenth of that amount to help other nations strengthen their independence and cure the social chaos in which communism always has thrived .
i am proud - and i think most americans are proud - of a mutual defense and assistance program , evolved with bipartisan support in three administrations , which has , with all its recognized problems , contributed to the fact that not a single one of the nearly fifty u. n . members to gain independence since the second world war has succumbed to communist control .
i am proud of a program that has helped to arm and feed and clothe millions of people who live on the front lines of freedom .
i am especially proud that this country has put forward for the 60 's a vast cooperative effort to achieve economic growth and social progress throughout the americas - the alliance for progress .
i do not underestimate the difficulties that we face in this mutual effort among our close neighbors , but the free states of this hemisphere , working in close collaboration , have begun to make this alliance a living reality .
today it is feeding one out of every four school age children in latin america an extra food ration from our farm surplus .
it has distributed 1.5 million school books and is building 17,000 classrooms .
it has helped resettle tens of thousands of farm families on land they can call their own .
it is stimulating our good neighbors to more self - help and self - reform - fiscal , social , institutional , and land reforms .
it is bringing new housing and hope , new health and dignity , to millions who were forgotten .
the men and women of this hemisphere know that the alliance cannot succeed if it is only another name for united states handouts - that it can succeed only as the latin american nations themselves devote their best effort to fulfilling its goals .
this story is the same in africa , in the middle east , and in asia .
wherever nations are willing to help themselves , we stand ready to help them build new bulwarks of freedom .
we are not purchasing votes for the cold war ; we have gone to the aid of imperiled nations , neutrals and allies alike .
what we do ask - and all that we ask - is that our help be used to best advantage , and that their own efforts not be diverted by needless quarrels with other independent nations .
despite all its past achievements , the continued progress of the mutual assistance program requires a persistent discontent with present performance .
we have been reorganizing this program to make it a more effective , efficient instrument - and that process will continue this year .
but free world development will still be an uphill struggle .
government aid can only supplement the role of private investment , trade expansion , commodity stabilization , and , above all , internal self - improvement .
the processes of growth are gradual - bearing fruit in a decade , not a day .
our successes will be neither quick nor dramatic .
but if these programs were ever to be ended , our failures in a dozen countries would be sudden and certain .
neither money nor technical assistance , however , can be our only weapon against poverty .
in the end , the crucial effort is one of purpose , requiring the fuel of finance but also a torch of idealism .
and nothing carries the spirit of this american idealism more effectively to the far corners of the earth than the american peace corps .
a year ago , less than 900 peace corps volunteers were on the job .
a year from now they will number more than 9,000 - men and women , aged 18 to 79 , willing to give 2 years of their lives to helping people in other lands .
there are , in fact , nearly a million americans serving their country and the cause of freedom in overseas posts , a record no other people can match .
surely those of us who stay at home should be glad to help indirectly ; by supporting our aid programs ; by opening our doors to foreign visitors and diplomats and students ; and by proving , day by day , by deed as well as word , that we are a just and generous people .
third , what comfort can we take from the increasing strains and tensions within the communist bloc ?
here hope must be tempered with caution .
for the soviet - chinese disagreement is over means , not ends .
a dispute over how best to bury the free world is no grounds for western rejoicing .
nevertheless , while a strain is not a fracture , it is clear that the forces of diversity are at work inside the communist camp , despite all the iron disciplines of regimentation and all the iron dogmatisms of ideology .
marx is proven wrong once again : for it is the closed communist societies , not the free and open societies which carry within themselves the seeds of internal disintegration .
the disarray of the communist empire has been heightened by two other formidable forces .
one is the historical force of nationalism - and the yearning of all men to be free .
the other is the gross inefficiency of their economies .
for a closed society is not open to ideas of progress - and a police state finds that it cannot command the grain to grow .
new nations asked to choose between two competing systems need only compare conditions in east and west germany , eastern and western europe , north and south viet nam .
they need only compare the disillusionment of communist cuba with the promise of the alliance for progress .
and all the world knows that no successful system builds a wall to keep its people in and freedom out - and the wall of shame dividing berlin is a symbol of communist failure .
finally , what can we do to move from the present pause toward enduring peace ?
again i would counsel caution .
i foresee no spectacular reversal in communist methods or goals .
but if all these trends and developments can persuade the soviet union to walk the path of peace , then let her know that all free nations will journey with her .
but until that choice is made , and until the world can develop a reliable system of international security , the free peoples have no choice but to keep their arms nearby .
this country , therefore , continues to require the best defense in the world - a defense which is suited to the sixties .
this means , unfortunately , a rising defense budget - for there is no substitute for adequate defense , and no `` bargain basement '' way of achieving it .
it means the expenditure of more than $ 15 billion this year on nuclear weapons systems alone , a sum which is about equal to the combined defense budgets of our european allies .
but it also means improved air and missile defenses , improved civil defense , a strengthened anti - guerrilla capacity and , of prime importance , more powerful and flexible non - nuclear forces .
for threats of massive retaliation may not deter piecemeal aggression - and a line of destroyers in a quarantine , or a division of well - equipped men on a border , may be more useful to our real security than the multiplication of awesome weapons beyond all rational need .
but our commitment to national safety is not a commitment to expand our military establishment indefinitely .
we do not dismiss disarmament as merely an idle dream .
for we believe that , in the end , it is the only way to assure the security of all without impairing the interests of any .
nor do we mistake honorable negotiation for appeasement .
while we shall never weary in the defense of freedom , neither shall we ever abandon the pursuit of peace .
in this quest , the united nations requires our full and continued support .
its value in serving the cause of peace has been shown anew in its role in the west new guinea settlement , in its use as a forum for the cuban crisis , and in its task of unification in the congo .
today the united nations is primarily the protector of the small and the weak , and a safety valve for the strong .
tomorrow it can form the framework for a world of law - a world in which no nation dictates the destiny of another , and in which the vast resources now devoted to destructive means will serve constructive ends .
in short , let our adversaries choose .
if they choose peaceful competition , they shall have it .
if they come to realize that their ambitions cannot succeed - if they see their `` wars of liberation '' and subversion will ultimately fail - if they recognize that there is more security in accepting inspection than in permitting new nations to master the black arts of nuclear war - and if they are willing to turn their energies , as we are , to the great unfinished tasks of our own peoples - then , surely , the areas of agreement can be very wide indeed : a clear understanding about berlin , stability in southeast asia , an end to nuclear testing , new checks on surprise or accidental attack , and , ultimately , general and complete disarmament .
for we seek not the worldwide victory of one nation or system but a worldwide victory of man .
the modern globe is too small , its weapons are too destructive , and its disorders are too contagious to permit any other kind of victory .
to achieve this end , the united states will continue to spend a greater portion of its national production than any other people in the free world .
for 15 years no other free nation has demanded so much of itself .
through hot wars and cold , through recession and prosperity , through the ages of the atom and outer space , the american people have never faltered and their faith has never flagged .
if at times our actions seem to make life difficult for others , it is only because history has made life difficult for us all .
but difficult days need not be dark .
i think these are proud and memorable days in the cause of peace and freedom .
we are proud , for example , of major rudolf anderson who gave his life over the island of cuba .
we salute specialist james allen johnson who died on the border of south korea .
we pay honor to sergeant gerald pendell who was killed in viet nam .
they are among the many who in this century , far from home , have died for our country .
our task now , and the task of all americans is to live up to their commitment .
my friends : i close on a note of hope .
we are not lulled by the momentary calm of the sea or the somewhat clearer skies above .
we know the turbulence that lies below , and the storms that are beyond the horizon this year .
but now the winds of change appear to be blowing more strongly than ever , in the world of communism as well as our own .
for 175 years we have sailed with those winds at our back , and with the tides of human freedom in our favor .
we steer our ship with hope , as thomas jefferson said , `` leaving fear astern .
`` today we still welcome those winds of change - and we have every reason to believe that our tide is running strong .
with thanks to almighty god for seeing us through a perilous passage , we ask his help anew in guiding the `` good ship union . ''

president lyndon b. johnson 's annual message to the congress on the state of the union
january 8 , 1964
mr. speaker , mr. president , members of the house and senate , my fellow americans : i will be brief , for our time is necessarily short and our agenda is already long .
last year 's congressional session was the longest in peacetime history .
with that foundation , let us work together to make this year 's session the best in the nation 's history .
let this session of congress be known as the session which did more for civil rights than the last hundred sessions combined ; as the session which enacted the most far - reaching tax cut of our time ; as the session which declared all - out war on human poverty and unemployment in these united states ; as the session which finally recognized the health needs of all our older citizens ; as the session which reformed our tangled transportation and transit policies ; as the session which achieved the most effective , efficient foreign aid program ever ; and as the session which helped to build more homes , more schools , more libraries , and more hospitals than any single session of congress in the history of our republic .
all this and more can and must be done .
it can be done by this summer , and it can be done without any increase in spending .
in fact , under the budget that i shall shortly submit , it can be done with an actual reduction in federal expenditures and federal employment .
we have in 1964 a unique opportunity and obligation -- to prove the success of our system ; to disprove those cynics and critics at home and abroad who question our purpose and our competence .
if we fail , if we fritter and fumble away our opportunity in needless , senseless quarrels between democrats and republicans , or between the house and the senate , or between the south and north , or between the congress and the administration , then history will rightfully judge us harshly .
but if we succeed , if we can achieve these goals by forging in this country a greater sense of union , then , and only then , can we take full satisfaction in the state of the union .
ii .
here in the congress you can demonstrate effective legislative leadership by discharging the public business with clarity and dispatch , voting each important proposal up , or voting it down , but at least bringing it to a fair and a final vote .
let us carry forward the plans and programs of john fitzgerald kennedy -- not because of our sorrow or sympathy , but because they are right .
in his memory today , i especially ask all members of my own political faith , in this election year , to put your country ahead of your party , and to always debate principles ; never debate personalities .
for my part , i pledge a progressive administration which is efficient , and honest and frugal .
the budget to be submitted to the congress shortly is in full accord with this pledge .
it will cut our deficit in half -- from $ 10 billion to $ 4 , 900 million .
it will be , in proportion to our national output , the smallest budget since 1951 .
it will call for a substantial reduction in federal employment , a feat accomplished only once before in the last 10 years .
while maintaining the full strength of our combat defenses , it will call for the lowest number of civilian personnel in the department of defense since 1950 .
it will call for total expenditures of $ 97 , 900 million -- compared to $ 98 , 400 million for the current year , a reduction of more than $ 500 million .
it will call for new obligational authority of $ 103 , 800 million -- a reduction of more than $ 4 billion below last year 's request of $ 107 , 900 million .
but it is not a standstill budget , for america cannot afford to stand still .
our population is growing .
our economy is more complex .
our people 's needs are expanding .
but by closing down obsolete installations , by curtailing less urgent programs , by cutting back where cutting back seems to be wise , by insisting on a dollar 's worth for a dollar spent , i am able to recommend in this reduced budget the most federal support in history for education , for health , for retraining the unemployed , and for helping the economically and the physically handicapped .
this budget , and this year 's legislative program , are designed to help each and every american citizen fulfill his basic hopes -- his hopes for a fair chance to make good ; his hopes for fair play from the law ; his hopes for a full - time job on full - time pay ; his hopes for a decent home for his family in a decent community ; his hopes for a good school for his children with good teachers ; and his hopes for security when faced with sickness or unemployment or old age .
iii .
unfortunately , many americans live on the outskirts of hope -- some because of their poverty , and some because of their color , and all too many because of both .
our task is to help replace their despair with opportunity .
this administration today , here and now , declares unconditional war on poverty in america .
i urge this congress and all americans to join with me in that effort .
it will not be a short or easy struggle , no single weapon or strategy will suffice , but we shall not rest until that war is won .
the richest nation on earth can afford to win it .
we cannot afford to lose it .
one thousand dollars invested in salvaging an unemployable youth today can return $ 40,000 or more in his lifetime .
poverty is a national problem , requiring improved national organization and support .
but this attack , to be effective , must also be organized at the state and the local level and must be supported and directed by state and local efforts .
for the war against poverty will not be won here in washington .
it must be won in the field , in every private home , in every public office , from the courthouse to the white house .
the program i shall propose will emphasize this cooperative approach to help that one - fifth of all american families with incomes too small to even meet their basic needs .
our chief weapons in a more pinpointed attack will be better schools , and better health , and better homes , and better training , and better job opportunities to help more americans , especially young americans , escape from squalor and misery and unemployment rolls where other citizens help to carry them .
very often a lack of jobs and money is not the cause of poverty , but the symptom .
the cause may lie deeper in our failure to give our fellow citizens a fair chance to develop their own capacities , in a lack of education and training , in a lack of medical care and housing , in a lack of decent communities in which to live and bring up their children .
but whatever the cause , our joint federal - local effort must pursue poverty , pursue it wherever it exists -- in city slums and small towns , in sharecropper shacks or in migrant worker camps , on indian reservations , among whites as well as negroes , among the young as well as the aged , in the boom towns and in the depressed areas .
our aim is not only to relieve the symptom of poverty , but to cure it and , above all , to prevent it .
no single piece of legislation , however , is going to suffice .
we will launch a special effort in the chronically distressed areas of appalachia .
we must expand our small but our successful area redevelopment program .
we must enact youth employment legislation to put jobless , aimless , hopeless youngsters to work on useful projects .
we must distribute more food to the needy through a broader food stamp program .
we must create a national service corps to help the economically handicapped of our own country as the peace corps now helps those abroad .
we must modernize our unemployment insurance and establish a high - level commission on automation .
if we have the brain power to invent these machines , we have the brain power to make certain that they are a boon and not a bane to humanity .
we must extend the coverage of our minimum wage laws to more than 2 million workers now lacking this basic protection of purchasing power .
we must , by including special school aid funds as part of our education program , improve the quality of teaching , training , and counseling in our hardest hit areas .
we must build more libraries in every area and more hospitals and nursing homes under the hill - burton act , and train more nurses to staff them .
we must provide hospital insurance for our older citizens financed by every worker and his employer under social security , contributing no more than $ 1 a month during the employee 's working career to protect him in his old age in a dignified manner without cost to the treasury , against the devastating hardship of prolonged or repeated illness .
we must , as a part of a revised housing and urban renewal program , give more help to those displaced by slum clearance , provide more housing for our poor and our elderly , and seek as our ultimate goal in our free enterprise system a decent home for every american family .
we must help obtain more modern mass transit within our communities as well as low - cost transportation between them .
above all , we must release $ 11 billion of tax reduction into the private spending stream to create new jobs and new markets in every area of this land .
iv .
these programs are obviously not for the poor or the underprivileged alone .
every american will benefit by the extension of social security to cover the hospital costs of their aged parents .
every american community will benefit from the construction or modernization of schools , libraries , hospitals , and nursing homes , from the training of more nurses and from the improvement of urban renewal in public transit .
and every individual american taxpayer and every corporate taxpayer will benefit from the earliest possible passage of the pending tax bill from both the new investment it will bring and the new jobs that it will create .
that tax bill has been thoroughly discussed for a year .
now we need action .
the new budget clearly allows it .
our taxpayers surely deserve it .
our economy strongly demands it .
and every month of delay dilutes its benefits in 1964 for consumption , for investment , and for employment .
for until the bill is signed , its investment incentives cannot be deemed certain , and the withholding rate cannot be reduced -- and the most damaging and devastating thing you can do to any businessman in america is to keep him in doubt and to keep him guessing on what our tax policy is .
and i say that we should now reduce to 14 percent instead of 15 percent our withholding rate .
i therefore urge the congress to take final action on this bill by the first of february , if at all possible .
for however proud we may be of the unprecedented progress of our free enterprise economy over the last 3 years , we should not and we cannot permit it to pause .
in 1963 , for the first time in history , we crossed the 70 million job mark , but we will soon need more than 75 million jobs .
in 1963 our gross national product reached the $ 600 billion level --$ 100 billion higher than when we took office .
but it easily could and it should be still $ 30 billion higher today than it is .
wages and profits and family income are also at their highest levels in history -- but i would remind you that 4 million workers and 13 percent of our industrial capacity are still idle today .
we need a tax cut now to keep this country moving .
v . for our goal is not merely to spread the work .
our goal is to create more jobs .
i believe the enactment of a 35 - hour week would sharply increase costs , would invite inflation , would impair our ability to compete , and merely share instead of creating employment .
but i am equally opposed to the 45 - or 50 - hour week in those industries where consistently excessive use of overtime causes increased unemployment .
so , therefore , i recommend legislation authorizing the creation of a tripartite industry committee to determine on an industry - by - industry basis as to where a higher penalty rate for overtime would increase job openings without unduly increasing costs , and authorizing the establishment of such higher rates .
vi .
let me make one principle of this administration abundantly clear : all of these increased opportunities -- in employment , in education , in housing , and in every field -- must be open to americans of every color .
as far as the writ of federal law will run , we must abolish not some , but all racial discrimination .
for this is not merely an economic issue , or a social , political , or international issue .
it is a moral issue , and it must be met by the passage this session of the bill now pending in the house .
all members of the public should have equal access to facilities open to the public .
all members of the public should be equally eligible for federal benefits that are financed by the public .
all members of the public should have an equal chance to vote for public officials and to send their children to good public schools and to contribute their talents to the public good .
today , americans of all races stand side by side in berlin and in viet nam .
they died side by side in korea .
surely they can work and eat and travel side by side in their own country .
vii .
we must also lift by legislation the bars of discrimination against those who seek entry into our country , particularly those who have much needed skills and those joining their families .
in establishing preferences , a nation that was built by the immigrants of all lands can ask those who now seek admission : " what can you do for our country ?
" but we should not be asking : " in what country were you born ?
"
viii .
for our ultimate goal is a world without war , a world made safe for diversity , in which all men , goods , and ideas can freely move across every border and every boundary .
we must advance toward this goal in 1964 in at least 10 different ways , not as partisans , but as patriots .
first , wc must maintain -- and our reduced defense budget will maintain -- that margin of military safety and superiority obtained through 3 years of steadily increasing both the quality and the quantity of our strategic , our conventional , and our antiguerilla forces .
in 1964 we will be better prepared than ever before to defend the cause of freedom , whether it is threatened by outright aggression or by the infiltration practiced by those in hanoi and havana , who ship arms and men across international borders to foment insurrection .
and we must continue to use that strength as john kennedy used it in the cuban crisis and for the test ban treaty -- to demonstrate both the futility of nuclear war and the possibilities of lasting peace .
second , we must take new steps -- and we shall make new proposals at geneva -- toward the control and the eventual abolition of arms .
even in the absence of agreement , we must not stockpile arms beyond our needs or seek an excess of military power that could be provocative as well as wasteful .
it is in this spirit that in this fiscal year we are cutting back our production of enriched uranium by 25 percent .
we are shutting down four plutonium piles .
we are closing many nonessential military installations .
and it is in this spirit that we today call on our adversaries to do the same .
third , we must make increased use of our food as an instrument of peace -- making it available by sale or trade or loan or donation - to hungry people in all nations which tell us of their needs and accept proper conditions of distribution .
fourth , we must assure our pre - eminence in the peaceful exploration of outer space , focusing on an expedition to the moon in this decade -- in cooperation with other powers if possible , alone if necessary .
fifth , we must expand world trade .
having recognized in the act of 1962 that we must buy as well as sell , we now expect our trading partners to recognize that we must sell as well as buy .
we are willing to give them competitive access to our market , asking only that they do the same for us .
sixth , we must continue , through such measures as the interest equalization tax , as well as the cooperation of other nations , our recent progress toward balancing our international accounts .
this administration must and will preserve the present gold value of the dollar .
seventh , we must become better neighbors with the free states of the americas , working with the councils of the oas , with a stronger alliance for progress , and with all the men and women of this hemisphere who really believe in liberty and justice for all .
eighth , we must strengthen the ability of free nations everywhere to develop their independence and raise their standard of living , and thereby frustrate those who prey on poverty and chaos .
to do this , the rich must help the poor -- and we must do our part .
we must achieve a more rigorous administration of our development assistance , with larger roles for private investors , for other industrialized nations , and for international agencies and for the recipient nations themselves .
ninth , we must strengthen our atlantic and pacific partnerships , maintain our alliances and make the united nations a more effective instrument for national independence and international order .
tenth , and finally , we must develop with our allies new means of bridging the gap between the east and the west , facing danger boldly wherever danger exists , but being equally bold in our search for new agreements which can enlarge the hopes of all , while violating the interests of none .
in short , i would say to the congress that we must be constantly prepared for the worst , and constantly acting for the best .
we must be strong enough to win any war , and we must be wise enough to prevent one .
we shall neither act as aggressors nor tolerate acts of aggression .
we intend to bury no one , and we do not intend to be buried .
we can fight , if we must , as we have fought before , but we pray that we will never have to fight again .
ix .
my good friends and my fellow americans : in these last 7 sorrowful weeks , we have learned anew that nothing is so enduring as faith , and nothing is so degrading as hate .
john kennedy was a victim of hate , but he was also a great builder of faith -- faith in our fellow americans , whatever their creed or their color or their station in life ; faith in the future of man , whatever his divisions and differences .
this faith was echoed in all parts of the world .
on every continent and in every land to which mrs . johnson and i traveled , we found faith and hope and love toward this land of america and toward our people .
so i ask you now in the congress and in the country to join with me in expressing and fulfilling that faith in working for a nation , a nation that is free from want and a world that is free from hate -- a world of peace and justice , and freedom and abundance , for our time and for all time to come .
president lyndon b. johnson 's annual message to the congress on the state of the union
january 4 , 1965
mr. speaker , mr. president , members of the congress , my fellow americans : on this hill which was my home , i am stirred by old friendships .
though total agreement between the executive and the congress is impossible , total respect is important .
i am proud to be among my colleagues of the congress whose legacy to their trust is their loyalty to their nation .
i am not unaware of the inner emotions of the new members of this body tonight .
twenty - eight years ago , i felt as you do now .
you will soon learn that you are among men whose first love is their country , men who try each day to do as best they can what they believe is right .
we are entering the third century of the pursuit of american union .
two hundred years ago , in 1765 , nine assembled colonies first joined together to demand freedom from arbitrary power .
for the first century we struggled to hold together the first continental union of democracy in the history of man .
one hundred years ago , in 1865 , following a terrible test of blood and fire , the compact of union was finally sealed .
for a second century we labored to establish a unity of purpose and interest among the many groups which make up the american community .
that struggle has often brought pain and violence .
it is not yet over .
but we have achieved a unity of interest among our people that is unmatched in the history of freedom .
and so tonight , now , in 1965 , we begin a new quest for union .
we seek the unity of man with the world that he has built -- with the knowledge that can save or destroy him -- with the cities which can stimulate or stifle him -- with the wealth and the machines which can enrich or menace his spirit .
we seek to establish a harmony between man and society which will allow each of us to enlarge the meaning of his life and all of us to elevate the quality of our civilization .
this is the search that we begin tonight .
state of the world but the unity we seek cannot realize its full promise in isolation .
for today the state of the union depends , in large measure , upon the state of the world .
our concern and interest , compassion and vigilance , extend to every corner of a dwindling planet .
yet , it is not merely our concern but the concern of all free men .
we will not , and we should not , assume that it is the task of americans alone to settle all the conflicts of a torn and troubled world .
let the foes of freedom take no comfort from this .
for in concert with other nations , we shall help men defend their freedom .
our first aim remains the safety and the well - being of our own country .
we are prepared to live as good neighbors with all , but we cannot be indifferent to acts designed to injure our interests , or our citizens , or our establishments abroad .
the community of nations requires mutual respect .
we shall extend it -- and we shall expect it .
in our relations with the world we shall follow the example of andrew jackson who said : " i intend to ask for nothing that is not clearly right and to submit to nothing that is wrong .
" and he promised , that " the honor of my country shall never be stained by an apology from me for the statement of truth or for the performance of duty .
" that was this nation 's policy in the 1830 's and that is this nation 's policy in the 1960 's .
our own freedom and growth have never been the final goal of the american dream .
we were never meant to be an oasis of liberty and abundance in a worldwide desert of disappointed dreams .
our nation was created to help strike away the chains of ignorance and misery and tyranny wherever they keep man less than god means him to be .
we are moving toward that destiny , never more rapidly than we have moved in the last 4 years .
in this period we have built a military power strong enough to meet any threat and destroy any adversary .
and that superiority will continue to grow so long as this office is mine -- and you sit on capitol hill .
in this period no new nation has become communist , and the unity of the communist empire has begun to crumble .
in this period we have resolved in friendship our disputes with our neighbors of the hemisphere , and joined in an alliance for progress toward economic growth and political democracy .
in this period we have taken more steps toward peace -- including the test ban treaty -- than at any time since the cold war began .
in this period we have relentlessly pursued our advances toward the conquest of space .
most important of all , in this period , the united states has reemerged into the fullness of its self - confidence and purpose .
no longer are we called upon to get america moving .
we are moving .
no longer do we doubt our strength or resolution .
we are strong and we have proven our resolve .
no longer can anyone wonder whether we are in the grip of historical decay .
we know that history is ours to make .
and if there is great danger , there is now also the excitement of great expectations .
america and the communist nations yet we still live in a troubled and perilous world .
there is no longer a single threat .
there are many .
they differ in intensity and in danger .
they require different attitudes and different answers .
with the soviet union we seek peaceful understandings that can lessen the danger to freedom .
last fall i asked the american people to choose that course .
i will carry forward their command .
if we are to live together in peace , we must come to know each other better .
i am sure that the american people would welcome a chance to listen to the soviet leaders on our television -- as i would like the soviet people to hear our leaders on theirs .
i hope the new soviet leaders can visit america so they can learn about our country at firsthand .
in eastern europe restless nations are slowly beginning to assert their identity .
your government , assisted by the leaders in american labor and business , is now exploring ways to increase peaceful trade with these countries and with the soviet union .
i will report our conclusions to the congress .
in asia , communism wears a more aggressive face .
we see that in viet - nam .
why are we there ?
we are there , first , because a friendly nation has asked us for help against the communist aggression .
ten years ago our president pledged our help .
three presidents have supported that pledge .
we will not break it now .
second , our own security is tied to the peace of asia .
twice in one generation we have had to fight against aggression in the far east .
to ignore aggression now would only increase the danger of a much larger war .
our goal is peace in southeast asia .
that will come only when aggressors leave their neighbors in peace .
what is at stake is the cause of freedom and in that cause america will never be found wanting .
the non - communist world but communism is not the only source of trouble and unrest .
there are older and deeper sources -- in the misery of nations and in man 's irrepressible ambition for liberty and a better life .
with the free republics of latin america i have always felt -- and my country has always felt -- very special ties of interest and affection .
it will be the purpose of my administration to strengthen these ties .
together we share and shape the destiny of the new world .
in the coming year i hope to pay a visit to latin america .
and i will steadily enlarge our commitment to the alliance for progress as the instrument of our war against poverty and injustice in this hemisphere .
in the atlantic community we continue to pursue our goal of 20 years -- a europe that is growing in strength , unity , and cooperation with america .
a great unfinished task is the reunification of germany through self - determination .
this european policy is not based on any abstract design .
it is based on the realities of common interests and common values , common dangers and common expectations .
these realities will continue to have their way -- especially , i think , in our expanding trade and especially in our common defense .
free americans have shaped the policies of the united states .
and because we know these realities , those policies have been , and will be , in the interest of europe .
free europeans must shape the course of europe .
and , for the same reasons , that course has been , and will be , in our interest and in the interest of freedom .
i found this truth confirmed in my talks with european leaders in the last year .
i hope to repay these visits to some of our friends in europe this year .
in africa and asia we are witnessing the turbulent unfolding of new nations and continents .
we welcome them to the society of nations .
we are committed to help those seeking to strengthen their own independence , and to work most closely with those governments dedicated to the welfare of all of their people .
we seek not fidelity to an iron faith , but a diversity of belief as varied as man himself .
we seek not to extend the power of america but the progress of humanity .
we seek not to dominate others but to strengthen the freedom of all people .
i will seek new ways to use our knowledge to help deal with the explosion in world population and the growing scarcity in world resources .
finally , we renew our commitment to the continued growth and the effectiveness of the united nations .
the frustrations of the united nations are a product of the world that we live in , and not of the institution which gives them voice .
it is far better to throw these differences open to the assembly of nations than to permit them to fester in silent danger .
these are some of the goals of the american nation in the world in which we live .
for ourselves we seek neither praise nor blame , neither gratitude nor obedience .
we seek peace .
we seek freedom .
we seek to enrich the life of man .
for that is the world in which we will flourish and that is the world that we mean for all men to ultimately have .
toward the great society world affairs will continue to call upon our energy and our courage .
but today we can turn increased attention to the character of american life .
we are in the midst of the greatest upward surge of economic well - being in the history of any nation .
our flourishing progress has been marked by price stability that is unequalled in the world .
our balance of payments deficit has declined and the soundness of our dollar is unquestioned .
i pledge to keep it that way and i urge business and labor to cooperate to that end .
we worked for two centuries to climb this peak of prosperity .
but we are only at the beginning of the road to the great society .
ahead now is a summit where freedom from the wants of the body can help fulfill the needs of the spirit .
we built this nation to serve its people .
we want to grow and build and create , but we want progress to be the servant and not the master of man .
we do not intend to live in the midst of abundance , isolated from neighbors and nature , confined by blighted cities and bleak suburbs , stunted by a poverty of learning and an emptiness of leisure .
the great society asks not how much , but how good ; not only how to create wealth but how to use it ; not only how fast we are going , but where we are headed .
it proposes as the first test for a nation : the quality of its people .
this kind of society will not flower spontaneously from swelling riches and surging power .
it will not be the gift of government or the creation of presidents .
it will require of every american , for many generations , both faith in the destination and the fortitude to make the journey .
and like freedom itself , it will always be challenge and not fulfillment .
and tonight we accept that challenge .
a national agenda i propose that we begin a program in education to ensure every american child the fullest development of his mind and skills .
i propose that we begin a massive attack on crippling and killing diseases .
i propose that we launch a national effort to make the american city a better and a more stimulating place to live .
i propose that we increase the beauty of america and end the poisoning of our rivers and the air that we breathe .
i propose that we carry out a new program to develop regions of our country that are now suffering from distress and depression .
i propose that we make new efforts to control and prevent crime and delinquency .
i propose that we eliminate every remaining obstacle to the right and the opportunity to vote .
i propose that we honor and support the achievements of thought and the creations of art .
i propose that we make an all - out campaign against waste and inefficiency .
the task our basic task is threefold : first , to keep our economy growing ; -- to open for all americans the opportunity that is now enjoyed by most americans ; -- and to improve the quality of life for all .
in the next 6 weeks i will submit special messages with detailed proposals for national action in each of these areas .
tonight i would like just briefly to explain some of my major recommendations in the three main areas of national need .
iv .
a growing economy
basic policies first , we must keep our nation prosperous .
we seek full employment opportunity for every american citizen .
i will present a budget designed to move the economy forward .
more money will be left in the hands of the consumer by a substantial cut in excise taxes .
we will continue along the path toward a balanced budget in a balanced economy .
i confidently predict -- what every economic sign tells us tonight -- the continued flourishing of the american economy .
but we must remember that fear of a recession can contribute to the fact of a recession .
the knowledge that our government will , and can , move swiftly will strengthen the confidence of investors and business .
congress can reinforce this confidence by insuring that its procedures permit rapid action on temporary income tax cuts .
and special funds for job - creating public programs should be made available for immediate use if recession threatens .
our continued prosperity demands continued price stability .
business , labor , and the consumer all have a high stake in keeping wages and prices within the framework of the guideposts that have already served the nation so well .
finding new markets abroad for our goods depends on the initiative of american business .
but we stand ready -- with credit and other help -- to assist the flow of trade which will benefit the entire nation .
on the farms our economy owes much to the efficiency of our farmers .
we must continue to assure them the opportunity to earn a fair reward .
i have instructed the secretary of agriculture to lead a major effort to find new approaches to reduce the heavy cost of our farm programs and to direct more of our effort to the small farmer who needs the help the most .
increased prosperity we can help insure continued prosperity through : -- a regional recovery program to assist the development of stricken areas left behind by our national progress ; -- further efforts to provide our workers with the skills demanded by modern technology , for the laboring - man is an indispensable force in the american system ; -- the extension of the minimum wage to more than 2 million unprotected workers ; -- the improvement and the modernization of the unemployment compensation system .
and as pledged in our 1960 and 1964 democratic platforms , i will propose to congress changes in the taft - hartley act including section 14 ( b ).
i will do so hoping to reduce the conflicts that for several years have divided americans in various states of our union .
in a country that spans a continent modern transportation is vital to continued growth .
transportation for growth i will recommend heavier reliance on competition in transportation and a new policy for our merchant marine .
i will ask for funds to study high - speed rail transportation between urban centers .
we will begin with test projects between washington and boston .
on high - speed trains , passengers could travel this distance in less than 4 hours .
ii .
opportunity for all second , we must open opportunity to all our people .
most americans enjoy a good life .
but far too many are still trapped in poverty and idleness and fear .
let a just nation throw open to them the city of promise : -- to the elderly , by providing hospital care under social security and by raising benefit payments to those struggling to maintain the dignity of their later years ; -- to the poor and the unfortunate , through doubling the war against poverty this year ; -- to negro americans , through enforcement of the civil rights law and elimination of barriers to the right to vote ; -- to those in other lands that are seeking the promise of america , through an immigration law based on the work a man can do and not where he was born or how he spells his name .
iii .
to enrich the life of all our third goal is to improve the quality of american life .
through education we begin with learning .
every child must have the best education that this nation can provide .
thomas jefferson said that no nation can be both ignorant and free .
today no nation can be both ignorant and great .
in addition to our existing programs , i will recommend a new program for schools and students with a first year authorization of $ 1,500 million .
it will help at every stage along the road to learning .
for the preschool years we will help needy children become aware of the excitement of learning .
for the primary and secondary school years we will aid public schools serving low - income families and assist students in both public and private schools .
for the college years we will provide scholarships to high school students of the greatest promise and the greatest need and we will guarantee low - interest loans to students continuing their college studies .
new laboratories and centers will help our schools -- help them lift their standards of excellence and explore new methods of teaching .
these centers will provide special training for those who need and those who deserve special treatment .
through better health greatness requires not only an educated people but a healthy people .
our goal is to match the achievements of our medicine to the afflictions of our people .
we already carry on a large program in this country .
for research and health .
in addition , regional medical centers can provide the most advanced diagnosis and treatment for heart disease and cancer and stroke and other major diseases .
new support for medical and dental education will provide the trained people to apply our knowledge .
community centers can help the mentally ill and improve health care for school - age children from poor families , including services for the mentally retarded .
through improving the world we live in
the city an educated and healthy people require surroundings in harmony with their hopes .
in our urban areas the central problem today is to protect and restore man 's satisfaction in belonging to a community where he can find security and significance .
the first step is to break old patterns -- to begin to think and work and plan for the development of the entire metropolitan areas .
we will take this step with new programs of help for the basic community facilities and for neighborhood centers of health and recreation .
new and existing programs will be open to those cities which work together to develop unified long - range policies for metropolitan areas .
we must also make some very important changes in our housing programs if we are to pursue these same basic goals .
so a department of housing and urban development will be needed to spearhead this effort in our cities .
every citizen has the right to feel secure in his home and on the streets of his community .
to help control crime , we will recommend programs : -- to train local law enforcement officers ; -- to put the best techniques of modern science at their disposal ; -- to discover the causes of crime and better ways to prevent it .
i will soon assemble a panel of outstanding experts of this nation to search out answers to the national problem of crime and delinquency , and i welcome the recommendations and the constructive efforts of the congress .
the beauty of america for over three centuries the beauty of america has sustained our spirit and has enlarged our vision .
we must act now to protect this heritage .
in a fruitful new partnership with the states and the cities the next decade should be a conservation milestone .
we must make a massive effort to save the countryside and to establish -- as a green legacy for tomorrow -- more large and small parks , more seashores and open spaces than have been created during any other period in our national history .
a new and substantial effort must be made to landscape highways to provide places of relaxation and recreation wherever our roads run , within our cities imaginative programs are needed to landscape streets and to transform open areas into places of beauty and recreation .
we will seek legal power to prevent pollution of our air and water before it happens .
we will step up our effort to control harmful wastes , giving first priority to the cleanup of our most contaminated rivers .
we will increase research to learn much more about the control of pollution .
we hope to make the potomac a model of beauty here in the capital , and preserve unspoiled stretches of some of our waterways with a wild rivers bill .
more ideas for a beautiful america will emerge from a white house conference on natural beauty which i will soon call .
art and science we must also recognize and encourage those who can be pathfinders for the nation 's imagination and understanding .
to help promote and honor creative achievements , i will propose a national foundation on the arts .
to develop knowledge which will enrich our lives and ensure our progress , i will recommend programs to encourage basic science , particularly in the universities -- and to bring closer the day when the oceans will supply our growing need for fresh water .
iv .
the government for government to serve these goals it must be modern in structure , efficient in action , and ready for any emergency .
i am busy , currently , reviewing the structure of the entire executive branch of this government .
i hope to reshape it and to reorganize it to meet more effectively the tasks of the 20th century .
wherever waste is found , i will eliminate it .
last year we saved almost $ 3,500 million by eliminating waste in the national government .
and i intend to do better this year .
and very soon i will report to you on our progress and on new economies that your government plans to make .
even the best of government is subject to the worst of hazards .
i will propose laws to insure the necessary continuity of leadership should the president become disabled or die .
in addition , i will propose reforms in the electoral college -- leaving undisturbed the vote by states -- but making sure that no elector can substitute his will for that of the people .
last year , in a sad moment , i came here and i spoke to you after 33 years of public service , practically all of them here on this hill .
this year i speak after 1 year as president of the united states .
many of you in this chamber are among my oldest friends .
we have shared many happy moments and many hours of work , and we have watched many presidents together .
yet , only in the white house can you finally know the full weight of this office .
the greatest burden is not running the huge operations of government -- or meeting daily troubles , large and small -- or even working with the congress .
a president 's hardest task is not to do what is right , but to know what is right .
yet the presidency brings no special gift of prophecy or foresight .
you take an oath , you step into an office , and you must then help guide a great democracy .
the answer was waiting for me in the land where i was born .
it was once barren land .
the angular hills were covered with scrub cedar and a few large live oaks .
little would grow in that harsh caliche soil of my country .
and each spring the pedernales river would flood our valley .
but men came and they worked and they endured and they built .
and tonight that country is abundant ; abundant with fruit and cattle and goats and sheep , and there are pleasant homes and lakes and the floods are gone .
why did men come to that once forbidding land ?
well , they were restless , of course , and they had to be moving on .
but there was more than that .
there was a dream -- a dream of a place where a free man could build for himself , and raise his children to a better life -- a dream of a continent to be conquered , a world to be won , a nation to be made .
remembering this , i knew the answer .
a president does not shape a new and personal vision of america .
he collects it from the scattered hopes of the american past .
it existed when the first settlers saw the coast of a new world , and when the first pioneers moved westward .
it has guided us every step of the way .
it sustains every president .
but it is also your inheritance and it belongs equally to all the people that we all serve .
it must be interpreted anew by each generation for its own needs ; as i have tried , in part , to do tonight .
it shall lead us as we enter the third century of the search for " a more perfect union .
" this , then , is the state of the union : free and restless , growing and full of hope .
so it was in the beginning .
so it shall always be , while god is willing , and we are strong enough to keep the faith .
special message to the congress : the american promise
march 15 , 1965
mr. speaker , mr. president , members of the congress : i speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy .
i urge every member of both parties , americans of all religions and of all colors , from every section of this country , to join me in that cause .
at times history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in man 's unending search for freedom .
so it was at lexington and concord .
so it was a century ago at appomattox .
so it was last week in selma , alabama .
there , long - suffering men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as americans .
many were brutally assaulted .
one good man , a man of god , was killed .
there is no cause for pride in what has happened in selma .
there is no cause for self - satisfaction in the long denial of equal rights of millions of americans .
but there is cause for hope and for faith in our democracy in what is happening here tonight .
for the cries of pain and the hymns and protests of oppressed people have summoned into convocation all the majesty of this great government -- the government of the greatest nation on earth .
our mission is at once the oldest and the most basic of this country : to right wrong , to do justice , to serve man .
in our time we have come to live with moments of great crisis .
our lives have been marked with debate about great issues ; issues of war and peace , issues of prosperity and depression .
but rarely in any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of america itself .
rarely are we met with a challenge , not to our growth or abundance , our welfare or our security , but rather to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved nation .
the issue of equal rights for american negroes is such an issue .
and should we defeat every enemy , should we double our wealth and conquer the stars , and still be unequal to this issue , then we will have failed as a people and as a nation .
for with a country as with a person , " what is a man profited , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ?
" there is no negro problem .
there is no southern problem .
there is no northern problem .
there is only an american problem .
and we are met here tonight as americans -- not as democrats or republicans - we are met here as americans to solve that problem .
this was the first nation in the history of the world to be founded with a purpose .
the great phrases of that purpose still sound in every american heart , north and south : " all men are created equal "--" government by consent of the governed "--" give me liberty or give me death .
" well , those are not just clever words , or those are not just empty theories .
in their name americans have fought and died for two centuries , and tonight around the world they stand there as guardians of our liberty , risking their lives .
those words are a promise to every citizen that he shall share in the dignity of man .
this dignity cannot be found in a man 's possessions ; it cannot be found in his power , or in his position .
it really rests on his right to be treated as a man equal in opportunity to all others .
it says that he shall share in freedom , he shall choose his leaders , educate his children , and provide for his family according to his ability and his merits as a human being .
to apply any other test -- to deny a man his hopes because of his color or race , his religion or the place of his birth -- is not only to do injustice , it is to deny america and to dishonor the dead who gave their lives for american freedom .
the right to vote our fathers believed that if this noble view of the rights of man was to flourish , it must be rooted in democracy .
the most basic right of all was the right to choose your own leaders .
the history of this country , in large measure , is the history of the expansion of that right to all of our people .
many of the issues of civil rights are very complex and most difficult .
but about this there can and should be no argument .
every american citizen must have an equal right to vote .
there is no reason which can excuse the denial of that right .
there is no duty which weighs more heavily on us than the duty we have to ensure that right .
yet the harsh fact is that in many places in this country men and women are kept from voting simply because they are negroes .
every device of which human ingenuity is capable has been used to deny this right .
the negro citizen may go to register only to be told that the day is wrong , or the hour is late , or the official in charge is absent .
and if he persists , and if he manages to present himself to the registrar , he may be disqualified because he did not spell out his middle name or because he abbreviated a word on the application .
and if he manages to fill out an application he is given a test .
the registrar is the sole judge of whether he passes this test .
he may be asked to recite the entire constitution , or explain the most complex provisions of state law .
and even a college degree cannot be used to prove that he can read and write .
for the fact is that the only way to pass these barriers is to show a white skin .
experience has clearly shown that the existing process of law cannot overcome systematic and ingenious discrimination .
no law that we now have on the books - and i have helped to put three of them there -- can ensure the right to vote when local officials are determined to deny it .
in such a case our duty must be clear to all of us .
the constitution says that no person shall be kept from voting because of his race or his color .
we have all sworn an oath before god to support and to defend that constitution .
we must now act in obedience to that oath .
guaranteeing the right to vote wednesday i will send to congress a law designed to eliminate illegal barriers to the right to vote .
the broad principles of that bill will be in the hands of the democratic and republican leaders tomorrow .
after they have reviewed it , it will come here formally as a bill .
i am grateful for this opportunity to come here tonight at the invitation of the leadership to reason with my friends , to give them my views , and to visit with my former colleagues .
i have had prepared a more comprehensive analysis of the legislation which i had intended to transmit to the clerk tomorrow but which i will submit to the clerks tonight .
but i want to really discuss with you now briefly the main proposals of this legislation , this bill will strike down restrictions to voting in all elections -- federal , state , and local -- which have been used to deny negroes the right to vote .
this bill will establish a simple , uniform standard which cannot be used , however ingenious the effort , to flout our constitution .
it will provide for citizens to be registered by officials of the united states government if the state officials refuse to register them .
it will eliminate tedious , unnecessary lawsuits which delay the right to vote .
finally , this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting .
i will welcome the suggestions from all of the members of congress -- i have no doubt that i will get some -- on ways and means to strengthen this law and to make it effective .
but experience has plainly shown that this is the only path to carry out the command of the constitution .
to those who seek to avoid action by their national government in their own communities ; who want to and who seek to maintain purely local control over elections , the answer is simple : open your polling places to all your people .
allow men and women to register and vote whatever the color of their skin .
extend the rights of citizenship to every citizen of this land .
the need for action there is no constitutional issue here .
the command of the constitution is plain .
there is no moral issue .
it is wrong -- deadly wrong -- to deny any of your fellow americans the right to vote in this country .
there is no issue of states rights or national rights .
there is only the struggle for human rights .
i have not the slightest doubt what will be your answer .
the last time a president sent a civil rights bill to the congress it contained a provision to protect voting rights in federal elections .
that civil rights bill was passed after 8 long months of debate .
and when that bill came to my desk from the congress for my signature , the heart of the voting provision had been eliminated .
this time , on this issue , there must be no delay , no hesitation and no compromise with our purpose .
we cannot , we must not , refuse to protect the right of every american to vote in every election that he may desire to participate in .
and we ought not and we cannot and we must not wait another 8 months before we get a bill .
we have already waited a hundred years and more , and the time for waiting is gone .
so i ask you to join me in working long hours -- nights and weekends , if necessary -- to pass this bill .
and i do n't make that request lightly .
for from the window where i sit with the problems of our country i recognize that outside this chamber is the outraged conscience of a nation , the grave concern of many nations , and the harsh judgment of history on our acts .
we shall overcome but even if we pass this bill , the battle will not be over .
what happened in selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of america .
it is the effort of american negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of american life .
their cause must be our cause too .
because it is not just negroes , but really it is all of us , who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice .
and we shall overcome .
as a man whose roots go deeply into southern soil i know how agonizing racial feelings are .
i know how difficult it is to reshape the attitudes and the structure of our society .
but a century has passed , more than a hundred years , since the negro was freed .
and he is not fully free tonight .
it was more than a hundred years ago that abraham lincoln , a great president of another party , signed the emancipation proclamation , but emancipation is a proclamation and not a fact .
a century has passed , more than a hundred years , since equality was promised .
and yet the negro is not equal .
a century has passed since the day of promise .
and the promise is unkept .
the time of justice has now come .
i tell you that i believe sincerely that no force can hold it back .
it is right in the eyes of man and god that it should come .
and when it does , i think that day will brighten the lives of every american .
for negroes are not the only victims .
how many white children have gone uneducated , how many white families have lived in stark poverty , how many white lives have been scarred by fear , because we have wasted our energy and our substance to maintain the barriers of hatred and terror ?
so i say to all of you here , and to all in the nation tonight , that those who appeal to you to hold on to the past do so at the cost of denying you your future .
this great , rich , restless country can offer opportunity and education and hope to all : black and white , north and south , sharecropper and city dweller .
these are the enemies : poverty , ignorance , disease .
they are the enemies and not our fellow man , not our neighbor .
and these enemies too , poverty , disease and ignorance , we shall overcome .
an american problem now let none of us in any sections look with prideful righteousness on the troubles in another section , or on the problems of our neighbors .
there is really no part of america where the promise of equality has been fully kept .
in buffalo as well as in birmingham , in philadelphia as well as in selma , americans are struggling for the fruits of freedom .
this is one nation .
what happens in selma or in cincinnati is a matter of legitimate concern to every american .
but let each of us look within our own hearts and our own communities , and let each of us put our shoulder to the wheel to root out injustice wherever it exists .
as we meet here in this peaceful , historic chamber tonight , men from the south , some of whom were at iwo jima , men from the north who have carried old glory to far corners of the world and brought it back without a stain on it , men from the east and from the west , are all fighting together without regard to religion , or color , or region , in viet - nam .
men from every region fought for us across the world 20 years ago .
and in these common dangers and these common sacrifices the south made its contribution of honor and gallantry no less than any other region of the great republic -- and in some instances , a great many of them , more .
and i have not the slightest doubt that good men from everywhere in this country , from the great lakes to the gulf of mexico , from the golden gate to the harbors along the atlantic , will rally together now in this cause to vindicate the freedom of all americans .
for all of us owe this duty ; and i believe that all of us will respond to it .
your president makes that request of every american .
progress through the democratic process the real hero of this struggle is the american negro .
his actions and protests , his courage to risk safety and even to risk his life , have awakened the conscience of this nation .
his demonstrations have been designed to call attention to injustice , designed to provoke change , designed to stir reform .
he has called upon us to make good the promise of america .
and who among us can say that we would have made the same progress were it not for his persistent bravery , and his faith in american democracy .
for at the real heart of battle for equality is a deep - seated belief in the democratic process .
equality depends not on the force of arms or tear gas but upon the force of moral right ; not on recourse to violence but on respect for law and order .
there have been many pressures upon your president and there will be others as the days come and go .
but i pledge you tonight that we intend to fight this battle where it should be fought : in the courts , and in the congress , and in the hearts of men .
we must preserve the right of free speech and the right of free assembly .
but the right of free speech does not carry with it , as has been said , the right to holler fire in a crowded theater .
we must preserve the right to free assembly , but free assembly does not carry with it the right to block public thoroughfares to traffic .
we do have a right to protest , and a right to march under conditions that do not infringe the constitutional rights of our neighbors .
and i intend to protect all those rights as long as i am permitted to serve in this office .
we will guard against violence , knowing it strikes from our hands the very weapons which we seek -- progress , obedience to law , and belief in american values .
in selma as elsewhere we seek and pray for peace .
we seek order .
we seek unity .
but we will not accept the peace of stifled rights , or the order imposed by fear , or the unity that stifles protest .
for peace cannot be purchased at the cost of liberty .
in selma tonight , as in every -- and we had a good day there -- as in every city , we are working for just and peaceful settlement .
we must all remember that after this speech i am making tonight , after the police and the fbi and the marshals have all gone , and after you have promptly passed this bill , the people of selma and the other cities of the nation must still live and work together .
and when the attention of the nation has gone elsewhere they must try to heal the wounds and to build a new community .
this cannot be easily done on a battleground of violence , as the history of the south itself shows .
it is in recognition of this that men of both races have shown such an outstandingly impressive responsibility in recent days -- last tuesday , again today ,
rights must be opportunities the bill that i am presenting to you will be known as a civil rights bill .
but , in a larger sense , most of the program i am recommending is a civil rights program .
its object is to open the city of hope to all people of all races .
because all americans just must have the right to vote .
and we are going to give them that right .
all americans must have the privileges of citizenship regardless of race .
and they are going to have those privileges of citizenship regardless of race .
but i would like to caution you and remind you that to exercise these privileges takes much more than just legal right .
it requires a trained mind and a healthy body .
it requires a decent home , and the chance to find a job , and the opportunity to escape from the clutches of poverty .
of course , people cannot contribute to the nation if they are never taught to read or write , if their bodies are stunted from hunger , if their sickness goes untended , if their life is spent in hopeless poverty just drawing a welfare check .
so we want to open the gates to opportunity .
but we are also going to give all our people , black and white , the help that they need to walk through those gates .
the purpose of this government my first job after college was as a teacher in cotulla , tex ., in a small mexican - american school .
few of them could speak english , and i couldn ' t speak much spanish .
my students were poor and they often came to class without breakfast , hungry .
they knew even in their youth the pain of prejudice .
they never seemed to know why people disliked them .
but they knew it was so , because i saw it in their eyes .
i often walked home late in the afternoon , after the classes were finished , wishing there was more that i could do .
but all i knew was to teach them the little that i knew , hoping that it might help them against the hardships that lay ahead .
somehow you never forget what poverty and hatred can do when you see its scars on the hopeful face of a young child .
i never thought then , in 1928 , that i would be standing here in 1965 .
it never even occurred to me in my fondest dreams that i might have the chance to help the sons and daughters of those students and to help people like them all over this country .
but now i do have that chance -- and i ' ll let you in on a secret -- i mean to use it .
and i hope that you will use it with me .
this is the richest and most powerful country which ever occupied the globe .
the might of past empires is little compared to ours .
but i do not want to be the president who built empires , or sought grandeur , or extended dominion .
i want to be the president who educated young children to the wonders of their world .
i want to be the president who helped to feed the hungry and to prepare them to be taxpayers instead of taxeaters .
i want to be the president who helped the poor to find their own way and who protected the right of every citizen to vote in every election .
i want to be the president who helped to end hatred among his fellow men and who promoted love among the people of all races and all regions and all parties .
i want to be the president who helped to end war among the brothers of this earth .
and so at the request of your beloved speaker and the senator from montana ; the majority leader , the senator from illinois ; the minority leader , mr. mcculloch , and other members of both parties , i came here tonight -- not as president roosevelt came down one time in person to veto a bonus bill , not as president truman came down one time to urge the passage of a railroad bill -- but i came down here to ask you to share this task with me and to share it with the people that we both work for .
i want this to be the congress , republicans and democrats alike , which did all these things for all these people .
beyond this great chamber , out yonder in 50 states , are the people that we serve .
who can tell what deep and unspoken hopes are in their hearts tonight as they sit there and listen .
we all can guess , from our own lives , how difficult they often find their own pursuit of happiness , how many problems each little family has .
they look most of all to themselves for their futures .
but i think that they also look to each of us .
above the pyramid on the great seal of the united states it says -- in latin --" god has favored our undertaking .
" god will not favor everything that we do .
it is rather our duty to divine his will .
but i cannot help believing that he truly understands and that he really favors the undertaking that we begin here tonight .
president lyndon b. johnson 's annual message to the congress on the state of the union
january 12 , 1966
mr. speaker , mr. president , members of the house and the senate , my fellow americans : i come before you tonight to report on the state of the union for the third time .
i come here to thank you and to add my tribute , once more , to the nation 's gratitude for this , the 89th congress .
this congress has already reserved for itself an honored chapter in the history of america .
our nation tonight is engaged in a brutal and bitter conflict in vietnam .
later on i want to discuss that struggle in some detail with you .
it just must be the center of our concerns .
but we will not permit those who fire upon us in vietnam to win a victory over the desires and the intentions of all the american people .
this nation is mighty enough , its society is healthy enough , its people are strong enough , to pursue our goals in the rest of the world while still building a great society here at home .
and that is what i have come here to ask of you tonight .
i recommend that you provide the resources to carry forward , with full vigor , the great health and education programs that you enacted into law last year .
i recommend that we prosecute with vigor and determination our war on poverty .
i recommend that you give a new and daring direction to our foreign aid program , designed to make a maximum attack on hunger and disease and ignorance in those countries that are determined to help themselves , and to help those nations that are trying to control population growth .
i recommend that you make it possible to expand trade between the united states and eastern europe and the soviet union .
i recommend to you a program to rebuild completely , on a scale never before attempted , entire central and slum areas of several of our cities in america .
i recommend that you attack the wasteful and degrading poisoning of our rivers , and , as the cornerstone of this effort , clean completely entire large river basins .
i recommend that you meet the growing menace of crime in the streets by building up law enforcement and by revitalizing the entire federal system from prevention to probation .
i recommend that you take additional steps to insure equal justice to all of our people by effectively enforcing nondiscrimination in federal and state jury selection , by making it a serious federal crime to obstruct public and private efforts to secure civil rights , and by outlawing discrimination in the sale and rental of housing .
i recommend that you help me modernize and streamline the federal government by creating a new cabinet level department of transportation and reorganizing several existing agencies .
in turn , i will restructure our civil service in the top grades so that men and women can easily be assigned to jobs where they are most needed , and ability will be both required as well as rewarded .
i will ask you to make it possible for members of the house of representatives to work more effectively in the service of the nation through a constitutional amendment extending the term of a congressman to 4 years , concurrent with that of the president .
ii .
because of vietnam we cannot do all that we should , or all that we would like to do .
we will ruthlessly attack waste and inefficiency .
we will make sure that every dollar is spent with the thrift and with the commonsense which recognizes how hard the taxpayer worked in order to earn it .
we will continue to meet the needs of our people by continuing to develop the great society .
last year alone the wealth that we produced increased $ 47 billion , and it will soar again this year to a total over $ 720 billion .
because our economic policies have produced rising revenues , if you approve every program that i recommend tonight , our total budget deficit will be one of the lowest in many years .
it will be only $ 1 . 8 billion next year .
total spending in the administrative budget will be $ 112 . 8 billion .
revenues next year will be $ 111 billion .
on a cash basis -- which is the way that you and i keep our family budget -- the federal budget next year will actually show a surplus .
that is to say , if we include all the money that your government will take in and all the money that your government will spend , your government next year will collect one - half billion dollars more than it will spend in the year 1967 .
i have not come here tonight to ask for pleasant luxuries or for idle pleasures .
i have come here to recommend that you , the representatives of the richest nation on earth , you , the elected servants of a people who live in abundance unmatched on this globe , you bring the most urgent decencies of life to all of your fellow americans .
there are men who cry out : we must sacrifice .
well , let us rather ask them : who will they sacrifice ?
are they going to sacrifice the children who seek the learning , or the sick who need medical care , or the families who dwell in squalor now brightened by the hope of home ?
will they sacrifice opportunity for the distressed , the beauty of our land , the hope of our poor ?
time may require further sacrifices .
and if it does , then we will make them .
but we will not heed those who wring it from the hopes of the unfortunate here in a land of plenty .
i believe that we can continue the great society while we fight in vietnam .
but if there are some who do not believe this , then , in the name of justice , let them call for the contribution of those who live in the fullness of our blessing , rather than try to strip it from the hands of those that are most in need .
and let no one think that the unfortunate and the oppressed of this land sit stifled and alone in their hope tonight .
hundreds of their servants and their protectors sit before me tonight here in this great chamber .
iii .
the great society leads us along three roads -- growth and justice and liberation .
[ 1 .
] first is growth -- the national prosperity which supports the well - being of our people and which provides the tools of our progress .
i can report to you tonight what you have seen for yourselves already -- in every city and countryside .
this nation is flourishing .
workers are making more money than ever -- with after - tax income in the past 5 years up 33 percent ; in the last year alone , up 8 percent .
more people are working than ever before in our history -- an increase last year of 2 1 / 2 million jobs .
corporations have greater after - tax earnings than ever in history .
for the past 5 years those earnings have been up over 65 percent , and last year alone they had a rise of 20 percent .
average farm income is higher than ever .
over the past 5 years it is up 40 percent , and over the past year it is up 22 percent alone .
i was informed this afternoon by the distinguished secretary of the treasury that his preliminary estimates indicate that our balance of payments deficit has been reduced from $ 2 . 8 billion in 1964 to $ 1 . 3 billion , or less , in 1965 .
this achievement has been made possible by the patriotic voluntary cooperation of businessmen and bankers working with your government .
we must now work together with increased urgency to wipe out this balance of payments deficit altogether in the next year .
and as our economy surges toward new heights we must increase our vigilance against the inflation which raises the cost of living and which lowers the savings of every family in this land .
it is essential , to prevent inflation , that we ask both labor and business to exercise price and wage restraint , and i do so again tonight .
i believe it desirable , because of increased military expenditures , that you temporarily restore the automobile and certain telephone excise tax reductions made effective only 12 days ago .
without raising taxes -- or even increasing the total tax bill paid -- we should move to improve our withholding system so that americans can more realistically pay as they go , speed up the collection of corporate taxes , and make other necessary simplifications of the tax structure at an early date .
i hope these measures will be adequate .
but if the necessities of vietnam require it , i will not hesitate to return to the congress for additional appropriations , or additional revenues if they are needed .
[ 2 .
] the second road is justice .
justice means a man 's hope should not be limited by the color of his skin .
i propose legislation to establish unavoidable requirements for nondiscriminatory jury selection in federal and state courts -- and to give the attorney general the power necessary to enforce those requirements .
i propose legislation to strengthen authority of federal courts to try those who murder , attack , or intimidate either civil rights workers or others exercising their constitutional rights -- and to increase penalties to a level equal to the nature of the crime .
legislation , resting on the fullest constitutional authority of the federal government , to prohibit racial discrimination in the sale or rental of housing .
for that other nation within a nation -- the poor -- whose distress has now captured the conscience of america , i will ask the congress not only to continue , but to speed up the war on poverty .
and in so doing , we will provide the added energy of achievement with the increased efficiency of experience .
to improve the life of our rural americans and our farm population , we will plan for the future through the establishment of several new community development districts , improved education through the use of teacher corps teams , better health measures , physical examinations , and adequate and available medical resources .
for those who labor , i propose to improve unemployment insurance , to expand minimum wage benefits , and by the repeal of section 14 ( b ) of the taft - hartley act to make the labor laws in all our states equal to the laws of the 31 states which do not have tonight right - to - work measures .
and i also intend to ask the congress to consider measures which , without improperly invading state and local authority , will enable us effectively to deal with strikes which threaten irreparable damage to the national interest .
[ 3 .
] the third path is the path of liberation .
it is to use our success for the fulfillment of our lives .
a great nation is one which breeds a great people .
a great people flower not from wealth and power , but from a society which spurs them to the fullness of their genius .
that alone is a great society .
yet , slowly , painfully , on the edge of victory , has come the knowledge that shared prosperity is not enough .
in the midst of abundance modern man walks oppressed by forces which menace and confine the quality of his life , and which individual abundance alone will not overcome .
we can subdue and we can master these forces -- bring increased meaning to our lives -- if all of us , government and citizens , are bold enough to change old ways , daring enough to assault new dangers , and if the dream is dear enough to call forth the limitless capacities of this great people .
this year we must continue to improve the quality of american life .
let us fulfill and improve the great health and education programs of last year , extending special opportunities to those who risk their lives in our armed forces .
i urge the house of representatives to complete action on three programs already passed by the senate -- the teacher corps , rent assistance , and home rule for the district of columbia .
in some of our urban areas we must help rebuild entire sections and neighborhoods containing , in some cases , as many as 100,000 people .
working together , private enterprise and government must press forward with the task of providing homes and shops , parks and hospitals , and all the other necessary parts of a flourishing community where our people can come to live the good life .
i will offer other proposals to stimulate and to reward planning for the growth of entire metropolitan areas .
of all the reckless devastations of our national heritage , none is really more shameful than the continued poisoning of our rivers and our air .
we must undertake a cooperative effort to end pollution in several river basins , making additional funds available to help draw the plans and construct the plants that are necessary to make the waters of our entire river systems clean , and make them a source of pleasure and beauty for all of our people .
to attack and to overcome growing crime and lawlessness , i think we must have a stepped - up program to help modernize and strengthen our local police forces .
our people have a right to feel secure in their homes and on their streets -- and that right just must be secured .
nor can we fail to arrest the destruction of life and property on our highways .
i will propose a highway safety act of 1966 to seek an end to this mounting tragedy .
we must also act to prevent the deception of the american consumer -- requiring all packages to state clearly and truthfully their contents -- all interest and credit charges to be fully revealed -- and keeping harmful drugs and cosmetics away from our stores .
it is the genius of our constitution that under its shelter of enduring institutions and rooted principles there is ample room for the rich fertility of american political invention .
we must change to master change .
i propose to take steps to modernize and streamline the executive branch , to modernize the relations between city and state and nation .
a new department of transportation is needed to bring together our transportation activities .
the present structure -- 35 government agencies , spending $ 5 billion yearly -- makes it almost impossible to serve either the growing demands of this great nation or the needs of the industry , or the right of the taxpayer to full efficiency and real frugality .
i will propose in addition a program to construct and to flight - test a new supersonic transport airplane that will fly three times the speed of sound -- in excess of 2,000 miles per hour .
i propose to examine our federal system -- the relation between city , state , nation , and the citizens themselves .
we need a commission of the most distinguished scholars and men of public affairs to do this job .
i will ask them to move on to develop a creative federalism to best use the wonderful diversity of our institutions and our people to solve the problems and to fulfill the dreams of the american people .
as the process of election becomes more complex and more costly , we must make it possible for those without personal wealth to enter public life without being obligated to a few large contributors .
therefore , i will submit legislation to revise the present unrealistic restriction on contributions -- to prohibit the endless proliferation of committees , bringing local and state committees under the act -- to attach strong teeth and severe penalties to the requirement of full disclosure of contributions -- and to broaden the participation of the people , through added tax incentives , to stimulate small contributions to the party and to the candidate of their choice .
to strengthen the work of congress i strongly urge an amendment to provide a 4 - year term for members of the house of representatives -- which should not begin before 1972 .
the present 2 - year term requires most members of congress to divert enormous energies to an almost constant process of campaigning -- depriving this nation of the fullest measure of both their skill and their wisdom .
today , too , the work of government is far more complex than in our early years , requiring more time to learn and more time to master the technical tasks of legislating .
and a longer term will serve to attract more men of the highest quality to political life .
the nation , the principle of democracy , and , i think , each congressional district , will all be better served by a 4 - year term for members of the house .
and i urge your swift action .
iv .
tonight the cup of peril is full in vietnam .
that conflict is not an isolated episode , but another great event in the policy that we have followed with strong consistency since world war ii .
the touchstone of that policy is the interest of the united states -- the welfare and the freedom of the people of the united states .
but nations sink when they see that interest only through a narrow glass .
in a world that has grown small and dangerous , pursuit of narrow aims could bring decay and even disaster .
an america that is mighty beyond description -- yet living in a hostile or despairing -- world would be neither safe nor free to build a civilization to liberate the spirit of man .
in this pursuit we helped rebuild western europe .
we gave our aid to greece and turkey , and we defended the freedom of berlin .
in this pursuit we have helped new nations toward independence .
we have extended the helping hand of the peace corps and carried forward the largest program of economic assistance in the world .
and in this pursuit we work to build a hemisphere of democracy and of social justice .
in this pursuit we have defended against communist aggression -- in korea under president truman -- in the formosa straits under president eisenhower -- in cuba under president kennedy -- and again in vietnam .
tonight vietnam must hold the center of our attention , but across the world problems and opportunities crowd in on the american nation .
i will discuss them fully in the months to come , and i will follow the five continuing lines of policy that america has followed under its last four presidents .
[ 1 .
] the first principle is strength .
tonight i can tell you that we are strong enough to keep all of our commitments .
we will need expenditures of $ 58 . 3 billion for the next fiscal year to maintain this necessary defense might .
while special vietnam expenditures for the next fiscal year are estimated to increase by $ 5 . 8 billion , i can tell you that all the other expenditures put together in the entire federal budget will rise this coming year by only $. 6 billion .
this is true because of the stringent cost - conscious economy program inaugurated in the defense department , and followed by the other departments of government .
[ 2 .
] a second principle of policy is the effort to control , and to reduce , and to ultimately eliminate the modern engines of destruction .
we will vigorously pursue existing proposals -- and seek new ones -- to control arms and to stop the spread of nuclear weapons .
[ 3 .
] a third major principle of our foreign policy is to help build those associations of nations which reflect the opportunities and the necessities of the modern world .
by strengthening the common defense , by stimulating world commerce , by meeting new hopes , these associations serve the cause of a flourishing world .
we will take new steps this year to help strengthen the alliance for progress , the unity of europe , the community of the atlantic , the regional organizations of developing continents , and that supreme association -- the united nations .
we will work to strengthen economic cooperation , to reduce barriers to trade , and to improve international finance .
[ 4 .
] a fourth enduring strand of policy has been to help improve the life of man .
from the marshall plan to this very moment tonight , that policy has rested on the claims of compassion , and the certain knowledge that only a people advancing in expectation will build secure and peaceful lands .
this year i propose major new directions in our program of foreign assistance to help those countries who will help themselves .
we will conduct a worldwide attack on the problems of hunger and disease and ignorance .
we will place the matchless skill and the resources of our own great america , in farming and in fertilizers , at the service of those countries committed to develop a modern agriculture .
we will aid those who educate the young in other lands , and we will give children in other continents the same head start that we are trying to give our own children .
to advance these ends i will propose the international education act of 1966 .
i will also propose the international health act of 1966 to strike at disease by a new effort to bring modern skills and knowledge to the uncared - for , those suffering in the world , and by trying to wipe out smallpox and malaria and control yellow fever over most of the world during this next decade ; to help countries trying to control population growth , by increasing our research -- and we will earmark funds to help their efforts .
in the next year , from our foreign aid sources , we propose to dedicate $ 1 billion to these efforts , and we call on all who have the means to join us in this work in the world .
[ 5 .
] the fifth and most important principle of our foreign policy is support of national independence -- the right of each people to govern themselves -- and to shape their own institutions .
for a peaceful world order will be possible only when each country walks the way that it has chosen to walk for itself .
we follow this principle by encouraging the end of colonial rule .
we follow this principle , abroad as well as at home , by continued hostility to the rule of the many by the few -- or the oppression of one race by another .
we follow this principle by building bridges to eastern europe .
and i will ask the congress for authority to remove the special tariff restrictions which are a barrier to increasing trade between the east and the west .
the insistent urge toward national independence is the strongest force of today 's world in which we live .
in africa and asia and latin america it is shattering the designs of those who would subdue others to their ideas or their will .
it is eroding the unity of what was once a stalinist empire .
in recent months a number of nations have cast out those who would subject them to the ambitions of mainland china .
history is on the side of freedom and is on the side of societies shaped from the genius of each people .
history does not favor a single system or belief -- unless force is used to make it so .
that is why it has been necessary for us to defend this basic principle of our policy , to defend it in berlin , in korea , in cuba -- and tonight in vietnam .
for tonight , as so many nights before , young americans struggle and young americans die in a distant land .
tonight , as so many nights before , the american nation is asked to sacrifice the blood of its children and the fruits of its labor for the love of its freedom .
how many times -- in my lifetime and in yours -- have the american people gathered , as they do now , to hear their president tell them of conflict and tell them of danger ?
each time they have answered .
they have answered with all the effort that the security and the freedom of this nation required .
and they do again tonight in vietnam .
not too many years ago vietnam was a peaceful , if troubled , land .
in the north was an independent communist government .
in the south a people struggled to build a nation , with the friendly help of the united states .
there were some in south vietnam who wished to force communist rule on their own people .
but their progress was slight .
their hope of success was dim .
then , little more than 6 years ago , north vietnam decided on conquest .
and from that day to this , soldiers and supplies have moved from north to south in a swelling stream that is swallowing the remnants of revolution in aggression .
as the assault mounted , our choice gradually became clear .
we could leave , abandoning south vietnam to its attackers and to certain conquest , or we could stay and fight beside the people of south vietnam .
we stayed .
and we will stay until aggression has stopped .
we will stay because a just nation cannot leave to the cruelties of its enemies a people who have staked their lives and independence on america 's solemn pledge -- a pledge which has grown through the commitments of three american presidents .
we will stay because in asia and around the world are countries whose independence rests , in large measure , on confidence in america 's word and in america 's protection .
to yield to force in vietnam would weaken that confidence , would undermine the independence of many lands , and would whet the appetite of aggression .
we would have to fight in one land , and then we would have to fight in another -- or abandon much of asia to the domination of communists .
and we do not intend to abandon asia to conquest .
last year the nature of the war in vietnam changed again .
swiftly increasing numbers of armed men from the north crossed the borders to join forces that were already in the south .
attack and terror increased , spurred and encouraged by the belief that the united states lacked the will to continue and that their victory was near .
despite our desire to limit conflict , it was necessary to act : to hold back the mounting aggression , to give courage to the people of the south , and to make our firmness clear to the north .
thus .
we began limited air action against military targets in north vietnam .
we increased our fighting force to its present strength tonight of 190,000 men .
these moves have not ended the aggression but they have prevented its success .
the aims of the enemy have been put out of reach by the skill and the bravery of americans and their allies -- and by the enduring courage of the south vietnamese who , i can tell you , have lost eight men last year for every one of ours .
the enemy is no longer close to victory .
time is no longer on his side .
there is no cause to doubt the american commitment .
our decision to stand firm has been matched by our desire for peace .
in 1965 alone we had 300 private talks for peace in vietnam , with friends and adversaries throughout the world .
since christmas your government has labored again , with imagination and endurance , to remove any barrier to peaceful settlement .
for 20 days now we and our vietnamese allies have dropped no bombs in north vietnam .
able and experienced spokesmen have visited , in behalf of america , more than 40 countries .
we have talked to more than a hundred governments , all 113 that we have relations with , and some that we do n't .
we have talked to the united nations and we have called upon all of its members to make any contribution that they can toward helping obtain peace .
in public statements and in private communications , to adversaries and to friends , in rome and warsaw , in paris and tokyo , in africa and throughout this hemisphere , america has made her position abundantly clear .
we seek neither territory nor bases , economic domination or military alliance in vietnam .
we fight for the principle of self - determination -- that the people of south vietnam should be able to choose their own course , choose it in free elections without violence , without terror , and without fear .
the people of all vietnam should make a free decision on the great question of reunification .
this is all we want for south vietnam .
it is all the people of south vietnam want .
and if there is a single nation on this earth that desires less than this for its own people , then let its voice be heard .
we have also made it clear -- from hanoi to new york -- that there are no arbitrary limits to our search for peace .
we stand by the geneva agreements of 1954 and 1962 .
we will meet at any conference table , we will discuss any proposals -- four points or fourteen or forty -- and we will consider the views of any group .
we will work for a cease - fire now or once discussions have begun .
we will respond if others reduce their use of force , and we will withdraw our soldiers once south vietnam is securely guaranteed the right to shape its own future .
we have said all this , and we have asked -- and hoped -- and we have waited for a response .
so far we have received no response to prove either success or failure .
we have carried our quest for peace to many nations and peoples because we share this planet with others whose future , in large measure , is tied to our own action , and whose counsel is necessary to our own hopes .
we have found understanding and support .
and we know they wait with us tonight for some response that could lead to peace .
i wish tonight that i could give you a blueprint for the course of this conflict over the coming months , but we just cannot know what the future may require .
we may have to face long , hard combat or a long , hard conference , or even both at once .
until peace comes , or if it does not come , our course is clear .
we will act as we must to help protect the independence of the valiant people of south vietnam .
we will strive to limit the conflict , for we wish neither increased destruction nor do we want to invite increased danger .
but we will give our fighting men what they must have : every gun , and every dollar , and every decision -- whatever the cost or whatever the challenge .
and we will continue to help the people of south vietnam care for those that are ravaged by battle , create progress in the villages , and carry forward the healing hopes of peace as best they can amidst the uncertain terrors of war .
and let me be absolutely clear : the days may become months , and the months may become years , but we will stay as long as aggression commands us to battle .
there may be some who do not want peace , whose ambitions stretch so far that war in vietnam is but a welcome and convenient episode in an immense design to subdue history to their will .
but for others it must now be clear -- the choice is not between peace and victory , it lies between peace and the ravages of a conflict from which they can only lose .
the people of vietnam , north and south , seek the same things : the shared needs of man , the needs for food and shelter and education -- the chance to build and work and till the soil , free from the arbitrary horrors of battle -- the desire to walk in the dignity of those who master their own destiny .
for many painful years , in war and revolution and infrequent peace , they have struggled to fulfill those needs .
it is a crime against mankind that so much courage , and so much will , and so many dreams , must be flung on the fires of war and death .
to all of those caught up in this conflict we therefore say again tonight : let us choose peace , and with it the wondrous works of peace , and beyond that , the time when hope reaches toward consummation , and life is the servant of life .
in this work , we plan to discharge our duty to the people whom we serve .
v . this is the state of the union .
but over it all -- wealth , and promise , and expectation -- lies our troubling awareness of american men at war tonight .
how many men who listen to me tonight have served their nation in other wars ?
how very many are not here to listen ?
the war in vietnam is not like these other wars .
yet , finally , war is always the same .
it is young men dying in the fullness of their promise .
it is trying to kill a man that you do not even know well enough to hate .
therefore , to know war is to know that there is still madness in this world .
many of you share the burden of this knowledge tonight with me .
but there is a difference .
for finally i must be the one to order our guns to fire , against all the most inward pulls of my desire .
for we have children to teach , and we have sick to be cured , and we have men to be freed .
there are poor to be lifted up , and there are cities to be built , and there is a world to be helped .
yet we do what we must .
i am hopeful , and i will try as best i can , with everything i have got , to end this battle and to return our sons to their desires .
yet as long as others will challenge america 's security and test the clearness of our beliefs with fire and steel , then we must stand or see the promise of two centuries tremble .
i believe tonight that you do not want me to try that risk .
and from that belief your president summons his strength for the trials that lie ahead in the days to come .
the work must be our work now .
scarred by the weaknesses of man , with whatever guidance god may offer us , we must nevertheless and alone with our mortality , strive to ennoble the life of man on earth .
thank you , and goodnight .
president lyndon b. johnson 's annual message to the congress on the state of the union
january 10 , 1967
mr. speaker , mr. vice president , distinguished members of the congress : i share with all of you the grief that you feel at the death today of one of the most beloved , respected , and effective members of this body , the distinguished representative from rhode island , mr. fogarty .
i have come here tonight to report to you that this is a time of testing for our nation .
at home , the question is whether we will continue working for better opportunities for all americans , when most americans are already living better than any people in history .
abroad , the question is whether we have the staying power to fight a very costly war , when the objective is limited and the danger to us is seemingly remote .
so our test is not whether we shrink from our country 's cause when the dangers to us are obvious and close at hand , but , rather , whether we carry on when they seem obscure and distant -- and some think that it is safe to lay down our burdens .
i have come tonight to ask this congress and this nation to resolve that issue : to meet our commitments at home and abroad -- to continue to build a better america -- and to reaffirm this nation 's allegiance to freedom .
as president abraham lincoln said , " we must ask where we are , and whither we are tending .
"
i .
the last 3 years bear witness to our determination to make this a better country .
we have struck down legal barriers to equality .
we have improved the education of 7 million deprived children and this year alone we have enabled almost 1 million students to go to college .
we have brought medical care to older people who were unable to afford it .
three and one - half million americans have already received treatment under medicare since july .
we have built a strong economy that has put almost 3 million more americans on the payrolls in the last year alone .
we have included more than 9 million new workers under a higher minimum wage .
we have launched new training programs to provide job skills for almost 1 million americans .
we have helped more than a thousand local communities to attack poverty in the neighborhoods of the poor .
we have set out to rebuild our cities on a scale that has never been attempted before .
we have begun to rescue our waters from the menace of pollution and to restore the beauty of our land and our countryside , our cities and our towns .
we have given 1 million young americans a chance to earn through the neighborhood youth corps -- or through head start , a chance to learn .
so together we have tried to meet the needs of our people .
and , we have succeeded in creating a better life for the many as well as the few .
now we must answer whether our gains shall be the foundations of further progress , or whether they shall be only monuments to what might have been -- abandoned now by a people who lacked the will to see their great work through .
i believe that our people do not want to quit -- though the task is great , the work hard , often frustrating , and success is a matter not of days or months , but of years -- and sometimes it may be even decades .
ii .
i have come here tonight to discuss with you five ways of carrying forward the progress of these last 3 years .
these five ways concern programs , partnerships , priorities , prosperity , and peace .
first , programs .
we must see to it , i think , that these new programs that we have passed work effectively and are administered in the best possible way .
three years ago we set out to create these new instruments of social progress .
this required trial and error -- and it has produced both .
but as we learn , through success and failure , we are changing our strategy and we are trying to improve our tactics .
in the long run , these starts -- some rewarding , others inadequate and disappointing -- are crucial to success .
one example is the struggle to make life better for the less fortunate among us .
on a similar occasion , at this rostrum in 1949 , i heard a great american president , harry s. truman , declare this : " the american people have decided that poverty is just as wasteful and just as unnecessary as preventable disease .
" many listened to president truman that day here in this chamber , but few understood what was required and did anything about it .
the executive branch and the congress waited 15 long years before ever taking any action on that challenge , as it did on many other challenges that great president presented .
and when , 3 years ago , you here in the congress joined with me in a declaration of war on poverty , then i warned , " it will not be a short or easy struggle -- no single weapon ... will suffice -- but we shall not rest until that war is won .
" and i have come here to renew that pledge tonight .
i recommend that we intensify our efforts to give the poor a chance to enjoy and to join in this nation 's progress .
i shall propose certain administrative changes suggested by the congress -- as well as some that we have learned from our own trial and error .
i shall urge special methods and special funds to reach the hundreds of thousands of americans that are now trapped in the ghettos of our big cities and , through head start , to try to reach out to our very young , little children .
the chance to learn is their brightest hope and must command our full determination .
for learning brings skills ; and skills bring jobs ; and jobs bring responsibility and dignity , as well as taxes .
this war -- like the war in vietnam -- is not a simple one .
there is no single battleline which you can plot each day on a chart .
the enemy is not easy to perceive , or to isolate , or to destroy .
there are mistakes and there are setbacks .
but we are moving , and our direction is forward .
this is true with other programs that are making and breaking new ground .
some do not yet have the capacity to absorb well or wisely all the money that could be put into them .
administrative skills and trained manpower are just as vital to their success as dollars .
and i believe those skills will come .
but it will take time and patience and hard work .
success cannot be forced at a single stroke .
so we must continue to strengthen the administration of every program if that success is to come -- as we know it must .
we have done much in the space of 2 short years , working together .
i have recommended , and you , the congress , have approved , 10 different reorganization plans , combining and consolidating many bureaus of this government , and creating two entirely new cabinet departments .
i have come tonight to propose that we establish a new department -- a department of business and labor .
by combining the department of commerce with the department of labor and other related agencies , i think we can create a more economical , efficient , and streamlined instrument that will better serve a growing nation .
this is our goal throughout the entire federal government .
every program will be thoroughly evaluated grant - in - aid programs will be improved and simplified as desired by many of our local administrators and our governors .
where there have been mistakes , we will try very hard to correct them .
where there has been progress , we will try to build upon it .
our second objective is partnership -- to create an effective partnership at all levels of government .
and i should treasure nothing more than to have that partnership begin between the executive and the congress .
the 88th and the 89th congresses passed more social and economic legislation than any two single congresses in american history .
most of you who were members of those congresses voted to pass most of those measures .
but your efforts will come to nothing unless it reaches the people .
federal energy is essential .
but it is not enough .
only a total working partnership among federal , state , and local governments can succeed .
the test of that partnership will be the concern of each public organization , each private institution , and each responsible citizen .
each state , county , and city needs to examine its capacity for government in today 's world , as we are examining ours in the executive department , and as i see you are examining yours .
some will need to reorganize and reshape their methods of administration -- as we are doing .
others will need to revise their constitutions and their laws to bring them up to date -- as we are doing .
above all , i think we must work together and find ways in which the multitudes of small jurisdictions can be brought together more efficiently .
during the past 3 years we have returned to state and local governments about $ 40 billion in grants - in - aid .
this year alone , 70 percent of our federal expenditures for domestic programs will be distributed through the state and local governments .
with federal assistance , state and local governments by 1970 will be spending close to $ 110 billion annually .
these enormous sums must be used wisely , honestly , and effectively .
we intend to work closely with the states and the localities to do exactly that .
our third objective is priorities , to move ahead on the priorities that we have established within the resources that are available .
i wish , of course , that we could do all that should be done -- and that we could do it now .
but the nation has many commitments and responsibilities which make heavy demands upon our total resources .
no administration would more eagerly utilize for these programs all the resources they require than the administration that started them .
so let us resolve , now , to do all that we can , with what we have -- knowing that it is far , far more than we have ever done before , and far , far less than our problems will ultimately require .
let us create new opportunities for our children and our young americans who need special help .
we should strengthen the head start program , begin it for children 3 years old , and maintain its educational momentum by following through in the early years .
we should try new methods of child development and care from the earliest years , before it is too late to correct .
and i will propose these measures to the 90th congress .
let us insure that older americans , and neglected americans , share in their nation 's progress .
we should raise social security payments by an overall average of 20 percent .
that will add $ 4 billion 100 million to social security payments in the first year .
i will recommend that each of the 23 million americans now receiving payments get an increase of at least 15 percent .
i will ask that you raise the minimum payments by 59 percent -- from $ 44 to $ 70 a month , and to guarantee a minimum benefit of $ 100 a month for those with a total of 25 years of coverage .
we must raise the limits that retired workers can earn without losing social security income .
we must eliminate by law unjust discrimination in employment because of age .
we should embark upon a major effort to provide self - help assistance to the forgotten in our midst -- the american indians and the migratory farm workers .
and we should reach with the hand of understanding to help those who live in rural poverty .
and i will propose these measures to the 90th congress .
so let us keep on improving the quality of life and enlarging the meaning of justice for all of our fellow americans .
we should transform our decaying slums into places of decency through the landmark model cities program .
i intend to seek for this effort , this year , the full amount that you in congress authorized last year .
we should call upon the genius of private industry and the most advanced technology to help rebuild our great cities .
we should vastly expand the fight for clean air with a total attack on pollution at its sources , and -- because air , like water , does not respect manmade boundaries -- we should set up " regional airsheds " throughout this great land .
we should continue to carry to every corner of the nation our campaign for a beautiful america -- to clean up our towns , to make them more beautiful , our cities , our countryside , by creating more parks , and more seashores , and more open spaces for our children to play in , and for the generations that come after us to enjoy .
we should continue to seek equality and justice for each citizen -- before a jury , in seeking a job , in exercising his civil rights .
we should find a solution to fair housing , so that every american , regardless of color , has a decent home of his choice .
we should modernize our selective service system .
the national commission on selective service will shortly submit its report .
i will send you new recommendations to meet our military manpower needs .
but let us resolve that this is to be the congress that made our draft laws as fair and as effective as possible .
we should protect what justice brandeis called the " right most valued by civilized men "-- the right to privacy .
we should outlaw all wiretapping -- public and private -- wherever and whenever it occurs , except when the security of this nation itself is at stake -- and only then with the strictest governmental safeguards .
and we should exercise the full reach of our constitutional powers to outlaw electronic " bugging " and " snooping .
" i hope this congress will try to help me do more for the consumer .
we should demand that the cost of credit be clearly and honestly expressed where average citizens can understand it .
we should immediately take steps to prevent massive power failures , to safeguard the home against hazardous household products , and to assure safety in the pipelines that carry natural gas across our nation .
we should extend medicare benefits that are now denied to 1 , 300,000 permanently and totally disabled americans under 65 years of age .
we should improve the process of democracy by passing our election reform and financing proposals , by tightening our laws regulating lobbying , and by restoring a reasonable franchise to americans who move their residences .
we should develop educational television into a vital public resource to enrich our homes , educate our families , and to provide assistance in our classrooms .
we should insist that the public interest be fully served through the public 's airwaves .
and i will propose these measures to the 90th congress .
now we come to a question that weighs very heavily on all our minds -- on yours and mine .
this nation must make an all - out effort to combat crime .
the 89th congress gave us a new start in the attack on crime by passing the law enforcement assistance act that i recommended .
we appointed the national crime commission to study crime in america and to recommend the best ways to carry that attack forward .
and while we do not have all the answers , on the basis of its preliminary recommendations we are ready to move .
this is not a war that washington alone can win .
the idea of a national police force is repugnant to the american people .
crime must be rooted out in local communities by local authorities .
our policemen must be better trained , must be better paid , and must be better supported by the local citizens that they try to serve and to protect .
the national government can and expects to help .
and so i will recommend to the 90th congress the safe streets and crime control act of 1967 .
it will enable us to assist those states and cities that try to make their streets and homes safer , their police forces better , their corrections systems more effective , and their courts more efficient .
when the congress approves , the federal government will be able to provide a substantial percentage of the cost :
-- 90 percent of the cost of developing the state and local plans , master plans , to combat crime in their area ; -- 60 percent of the cost of training new tactical units , developing instant communications and special alarm systems , and introducing the latest equipment and techniques so that they can become weapons in the war on crime ; -- 50 percent of the cost of building crime laboratories and police academy - type centers so that our citizens can be protected by the best trained and served by the best equipped police to be found anywhere .
we will also recommend new methods to prevent juvenile delinquents from becoming adult delinquents .
we will seek new partnerships with states and cities in order to deal with this hideous narcotics problem .
and we will recommend strict controls on the sale of firearms .
at the heart of this attack on crime must be the conviction that a free america -- as abraham lincoln once said -- must " let reverence for the laws .
.
.
become the political religion of the nation .
" our country 's laws must be respected .
order must be maintained .
and i will support -- with all the constitutional powers the president possesses -- our nation 's law enforcement officials in their attempt to control the crime and the violence that tear the fabric of our communities .
many of these priority proposals will be built on foundations that have already been laid .
some will necessarily be small at first , but " every beginning is a consequence .
" if we postpone this urgent work now , it will simply have to be done later , and later we will pay a much higher price .
our fourth objective is prosperity , to keep our economy moving ahead , moving ahead steadily and safely .
we have now enjoyed 6 years of unprecedented and rewarding prosperity .
last year , in 1966 :
-- wages were the highest in history -- and the unemployment rate , announced yesterday , reached the lowest point in 13 years ; -- total after - tax income of american families rose nearly 5 percent ; -- corporate profits after taxes rose a little more than 5 percent ; -- our gross national product advanced 5 . 5 percent , to about $ 740 billion ; -- income per farm went up 6 percent .
now we have been greatly concerned because consumer prices rose 4 . 5 percent over the 18 months since we decided to send troops to vietnam .
this was more than we had expected -- and the government tried to do everything that we knew how to do to hold it down .
yet we were not as successful as we wished to be .
in the 18 months after we entered world war ii , prices rose not 4 . 5 percent , but 13 . 5 percent .
in the first 18 months after korea , after the conflict broke out there , prices rose not 4 . 5 percent , but 11 percent .
during those two periods we had opa price control that the congress gave us and war labor board wage controls .
since vietnam we have not asked for those controls and we have tried to avoid imposing them .
we believe that we have done better , but we make no pretense of having been successful or doing as well as we wished .
our greatest disappointment in the economy during 1966 was the excessive rise in interest rates and the tightening of credit .
they imposed very severe and very unfair burdens on our home buyers and on our home builders , and all those associated with the home industry .
last january , and again last september , i recommended fiscal and moderate tax measures to try to restrain the unbalanced pace of economic expansion .
legislatively and administratively we took several billions out of the economy .
with these measures , in both instances , the congress approved most of the recommendations rather promptly .
as 1966 ended , price stability was seemingly being restored .
wholesale prices are lower tonight than they were in august .
so are retail food prices .
monetary conditions are also easing .
most interest rates have retreated from their earlier peaks .
more money now seems to be available .
given the cooperation of the federal reserve system , which i so earnestly seek , i am confident that this movement can continue .
i pledge the american people that i will do everything in a president 's power to lower interest rates and to ease money in this country .
the federal home loan bank board tomorrow morning will announce that it will make immediately available to savings and loan associations an additional $ 1 billion , and will lower from 6 percent to 5 3 / 4 percent the interest rate charged on those loans .
we shall continue on a sensible course of fiscal and budgetary policy that we believe will keep our economy growing without new inflationary spirals ; that will finance responsibly the needs of our men in vietnam and the progress of our people at home ; that will support a significant improvement in our export surplus , and will press forward toward easier credit and toward lower interest rates .
i recommend to the congress a surcharge of 6 percent on both corporate and individual income taxes -- to last for 2 years or for so long as the unusual expenditures associated with our efforts in vietnam continue .
i will promptly recommend an earlier termination date if a reduction in these expenditures permits it .
this surcharge will raise revenues by some $ 4 . 5 billion in the first year .
for example , a person whose tax payment , the tax he owes , is $ 1,000 , will pay , under this proposal , an extra $ 60 over the 12 - month period , or $ 5 a month .
the overwhelming majority of americans who pay taxes today are below that figure and they will pay substantially less than $ 5 a month .
married couples with two children , with incomes up to $ 5,000 per year , will be exempt from this tax -- as will single people with an income of up to $ 1 , 900 a year .
now if americans today still paid the income and excise tax rates in effect when i came into the presidency , in the year 1964 , their annual taxes would have been over $ 20 billion more than at present tax rates .
so this proposal is that while we have this problem and this emergency in vietnam , while we are trying to meet the needs of our people at home , your government asks for slightly more than one - fourth of that tax cut each year in order to try to hold our budget deficit in fiscal 1968 within prudent limits and to give our country and to give our fighting men the help they need in this hour of trial .
for fiscal 1967 , we estimate the budget expenditures to be $ 126 . 7 billion and revenues of $ 117 billion .
that will leave us a deficit this year of $ 9 . 7 billion .
for fiscal 1968 , we estimate budget expenditures of $ 135 billion .
and with the tax measures recommended , and a continuing strong economy , we estimate revenues will be $ 126 . 9 billion .
the deficit then will be $ 8 . 1 billion .
i will very soon forward all of my recommendations to the congress .
yours is the responsibility to discuss and to debate them -- to approve or modify or reject them .
i welcome your views , as i have welcomed working with you for 30 years as a colleague and as vice president and president .
i should like to say to the members of the opposition -- whose numbers , if i am not mistaken , seem to have increased somewhat -- that the genius of the american political system has always been best expressed through creative debate that offers choices and reasonable alternatives .
throughout our history , great republicans and democrats have seemed to understand this .
so let there be light and reason in our relations .
that is the way to a responsible session and a responsive government .
let us be remembered as a president and a congress who tried to improve the quality of life for every american -- not just the rich , not just the poor , but every man , woman , and child in this great nation of ours .
we all go to school -- to good schools or bad schools .
we all take air into our lungs -- clean air or polluted air .
we all drink water -- pure water or polluted water .
we all face sickness someday , and some more often than we wish , and old age as well .
we all have a stake in this great society -- in its economic growth , in reduction of civil strife -- a great stake in good government .
we just must not arrest the pace of progress we have established in this country in these years .
our children 's children will pay the price if we are not wise enough , and courageous enough , and determined enough to stand up and meet the nation 's needs as well as we can in the time allotted us .
iii .
abroad , as at home , there is also risk in change .
but abroad , as at home , there is a greater risk in standing still .
no part of our foreign policy is so sacred that it ever remains beyond review .
we shall be flexible where conditions in the world change -- and where man 's efforts can change them for the better .
we are in the midst of a great transition -- a transition from narrow nationalism to international partnership ; from the harsh spirit of the cold war to the hopeful spirit of common humanity on a troubled and a threatened planet .
in latin america , the american chiefs of state will be meeting very shortly to give our hemispheric policies new direction .
we have come a long way in this hemisphere since the inter - american effort in economic and social development was launched by the conference at bogota in 1960 under the leadership of president eisenhower .
the alliance for progress moved dramatically forward under president kennedy .
there is new confidence that the voice of the people is being heard ; that the dignity of the individual is stronger than ever in this hemisphere , and we are facing up to and meeting many of the hemispheric problems together .
in this hemisphere that reform under democracy can be made to happen -- because it has happened .
so together , i think , we must now move to strike down the barriers to full cooperation among the american nations , and to free the energies and the resources of two great continents on behalf of all of our citizens .
africa stands at an earlier stage of development than latin america .
it has yet to develop the transportation , communications , agriculture , and , above all , the trained men and women without which growth is impossible .
there , too , the job will best be done if the nations and peoples of africa cooperate on a regional basis .
more and more our programs for africa are going to be directed toward self - help .
the future of africa is shadowed by unsolved racial conflicts .
our policy will continue to reflect our basic commitments as a people to support those who are prepared to work towards cooperation and harmony between races , and to help those who demand change but reject the fool 's gold of violence .
in the middle east the spirit of good will toward all , unfortunately , has not yet taken hold .
an already tortured peace seems to be constantly threatened .
we shall try to use our influence to increase the possibilities of improved relations among the nations of that region .
we are working hard at that task .
in the great subcontinent of south asia live more than a sixth of the earth 's population .
over the years we -- and others -- have invested very heavily in capital and food for the economic development of india and pakistan .
we are not prepared to see our assistance wasted , however , in conflict .
it must strengthen their capacity to help themselves .
it must help these two nations -- both our friends -- to overcome poverty , to emerge as self - reliant leaders , and find terms for reconciliation and cooperation .
in western europe we shall maintain in nato an integrated common defense .
but we also look forward to the time when greater security can be achieved through measures of arms control and disarmament , and through other forms of practical agreement .
we are shaping a new future of enlarged partnership in nuclear affairs , in economic and technical cooperation , in trade negotiations , in political consultation , and in working together with the governments and peoples of eastern europe and the soviet union .
the emerging spirit of confidence is precisely what we hoped to achieve when we went to work a generation ago to put our shoulder to the wheel and try to help rebuild europe .
we faced new challenges and opportunities then and there -- and we faced also some dangers .
but i believe that the peoples on both sides of the atlantic , as well as both sides of this chamber , wanted to face them together .
our relations with the soviet union and eastern europe are also in transition .
we have avoided both the acts and the rhetoric of the cold war .
when we have differed with the soviet union , or other nations , for that matter , i have tried to differ quietly and with courtesy , and without venom .
our objective is not to continue the cold war , but to end it .
we have reached an agreement at the united nations on the peaceful uses of outer space .
we have agreed to open direct air flights with the soviet union .
we have removed more than 400 nonstrategic items from export control .
we are determined that the export - import bank can allow commercial credits to poland , hungary , bulgaria , and czechoslovakia , as well as to romania and yugoslavia .
we have entered into a cultural agreement with the soviet union for another 2 years .
we have agreed with bulgaria and hungary to upgrade our legations to embassies .
we have started discussions with international agencies on ways of increasing contacts with eastern european countries .
this administration has taken these steps even as duty compelled us to fulfill and execute alliances and treaty obligations throughout the world that were entered into before i became president .
so tonight i now ask and urge this congress to help our foreign and our commercial trade policies by passing an east - west trade bill and by approving our consular convention with the soviet union .
the soviet union has in the past year increased its long - range missile capabilities .
it has begun to place near moscow a limited antimissile defense .
my first responsibility to our people is to assure that no nation can ever find it rational to launch a nuclear attack or to use its nuclear power as a credible threat against us or against our allies .
i would emphasize that that is why an important link between russia and the united states is in our common interest , in arms control and in disarmament .
we have the solemn duty to slow down the arms race between us , if that is at all possible , in both conventional and nuclear weapons and defenses .
i thought we were making some progress in that direction the first few months i was in office .
i realize that any additional race would impose on our peoples , and on all mankind , for that matter , an additional waste of resources with no gain in security to either side .
i expect in the days ahead to closely consult and seek the advice of the congress about the possibilities of international agreements bearing directly upon this problem .
next to the pursuit of peace , the really greatest challenge to the human family is the race between food supply and population increase .
that race tonight is being lost .
the time for rhetoric has clearly passed .
the time for concerted action is here and we must get on with the job .
we believe that three principles must prevail if our policy is to succeed : first , the developing nations must give highest priority to food production , including the use of technology and the capital of private enterprise .
second , nations with food deficits must put more of their resources into voluntary family planning programs .
and third , the developed nations must all assist other nations to avoid starvation in the short run and to move rapidly towards the ability to feed themselves .
every member of the world community now bears a direct responsibility to help bring our most basic human account into balance .
iv .
i come now finally to southeast asia -- and to vietnam in particular .
soon i will submit to the congress a detailed report on that situation .
tonight i want to just review the essential points as briefly as i can .
we are in vietnam because the united states of america and our allies are committed by the seato treaty to " act to meet the common danger " of aggression in southeast asia .
we are in vietnam because an international agreement signed by the united states , north vietnam , and others in 1962 is being systematically violated by the communists .
that violation threatens the independence of all the small nations in southeast asia , and threatens the peace of the entire region and perhaps the world .
we are there because the people of south vietnam have as much right to remain non - communist -- if that is what they choose -- as north vietnam has to remain communist .
we are there because the congress has pledged by solemn vote to take all necessary measures to prevent further aggression .
no better words could describe our present course than those once spoken by the great thomas jefferson :
" it is the melancholy law of human societies to be compelled sometimes to choose a great evil in order to ward off a greater .
"
we have chosen to fight a limited war in vietnam in an attempt to prevent a larger war -- a war almost certain to follow , i believe , if the communists succeed in overrunning and taking over south vietnam by aggression and by force .
i believe , and i am supported by some authority , that if they are not checked now the world can expect to pay a greater price to check them later .
that is what our statesmen said when they debated this treaty , and that is why it was ratified 82 to 1 by the senate many years ago .
you will remember that we stood in western europe 20 years ago .
is there anyone in this chamber tonight who doubts that the course of freedom was not changed for the better because of the courage of that stand ?
sixteen years ago we and others stopped another kind of aggression -- this time it was in korea .
imagine how different asia might be today if we had failed to act when the communist army of north korea marched south .
the asia of tomorrow will be far different because we have said in vietnam , as we said 16 years ago in korea : " this far and no further .
" i think i reveal no secret when i tell you that we are dealing with a stubborn adversary who is committed to the use of force and terror to settle political questions .
i wish i could report to you that the conflict is almost over .
this i cannot do .
we face more cost , more loss , and more agony .
for the end is not yet .
i cannot promise you that it will come this year -- or come next year .
our adversary still believes , i think , tonight , that he can go on fighting longer than we can , and longer than we and our allies will be prepared to stand up and resist .
our men in that area -- there are nearly 500,000 now -- have borne well " the burden and the heat of the day .
" their efforts have deprived the communist enemy of the victory that he sought and that he expected a year ago .
we have steadily frustrated his main forces .
general westmoreland reports that the enemy can no longer succeed on the battlefield .
so i must say to you that our pressure must be sustained -- and will be sustained -- until he realizes that the war he started is costing him more than he can ever gain .
i know of no strategy more likely to attain that end than the strategy of " accumulating slowly , but inexorably , every kind of material resource "-- of " laboriously teaching troops the very elements of their trade .
" that , and patience -- and i mean a great deal of patience .
our south vietnamese allies are also being tested tonight .
because they must provide real security to the people living in the countryside .
and this means reducing the terrorism and the armed attacks which kidnaped and killed 26 , 900 civilians in the last 32 months , to levels where they can be successfully controlled by the regular south vietnamese security forces .
it means bringing to the villagers an effective civilian government that they can respect , and that they can rely upon and that they can participate in , and that they can have a personal stake in .
we hope that government is now beginning to emerge .
while i cannot report the desired progress in the pacification effort , the very distinguished and able ambassador , henry cabot lodge , reports that south vietnam is turning to this task with a new sense of urgency .
we can help , but only they can win this part of the war .
their task is to build and protect a new life in each rural province .
one result of our stand in vietnam is already clear .
it is this : the peoples of asia now know that the door to independence is not going to be slammed shut .
they know that it is possible for them to choose their own national destinies -- without coercion .
the performance of our men in vietnam -- backed by the american people -- has created a feeling of confidence and unity among the independent nations of asia and the pacific .
i saw it in their faces in the 19 days that i spent in their homes and in their countries .
fear of external communist conquest in many asian nations is already subsiding -- and with this , the spirit of hope is rising .
for the first time in history , a common outlook and common institutions are already emerging .
this forward movement is rooted in the ambitions and the interests of asian nations themselves .
it was precisely this movement that we hoped to accelerate when i spoke at johns hopkins in baltimore in april 1965 , and i pledged " a much more massive effort to improve the life of man " in that part of the world , in the hope that we could take some of the funds that we were spending on bullets and bombs and spend it on schools and production .
twenty months later our efforts have produced a new reality : the doors of the billion dollar asian development bank that i recommended to the congress , and you endorsed almost unanimously , i am proud to tell you are already open .
asians are engaged tonight in regional efforts in a dozen new directions .
their hopes are high .
their faith is strong .
their confidence is deep .
and even as the war continues , we shall play our part in carrying forward this constructive historic development .
as recommended by the eugene black mission , and if other nations will join us , i will seek a special authorization from the congress of $ 200 million for east asian regional programs .
we are eager to turn our resources to peace .
our efforts in behalf of humanity i think need not be restricted by any parallel or by any boundary line .
the moment that peace comes , as i pledged in baltimore , i will ask the congress for funds to join in an international program of reconstruction and development for all the people of vietnam -- and their deserving neighbors who wish our help .
we shall continue to hope for a reconciliation between the people of mainland china and the world community -- including working together in all the tasks of arms control , security , and progress on which the fate of the chinese people , like their fellow men elsewhere , depends .
we would be the first to welcome a china which decided to respect her neighbors ' rights .
we would be the first to applaud her were she to apply her great energies and intelligence to improving the welfare of her people .
and we have no intention of trying to deny her legitimate needs for security and friendly relations with her neighboring countries .
our hope that all of this will someday happen rests on the conviction that we , the american people and our allies , will and are going to see vietnam through to an honorable peace .
we will support all appropriate initiatives by the united nations , and others , which can bring the several parties together for unconditional discussions of peace -- anywhere , any time .
and we will continue to take every possible initiative ourselves to constantly probe for peace .
until such efforts succeed , or until the infiltration ceases , or until the conflict subsides , i think the course of wisdom for this country is that we just must firmly pursue our present course .
we will stand firm in vietnam .
i think you know that our fighting men there tonight bear the heaviest burden of all .
with their lives they serve their nation .
we must give them nothing less than our full support -- and we have given them that -- nothing less than the determination that americans have always given their fighting men .
whatever our sacrifice here , even if it is more than $ 5 a month , it is small compared to their own .
how long it will take i cannot prophesy .
i only know that the will of the american people , i think , is tonight being tested .
whether we can fight a war of limited objectives over a period of time , and keep alive the hope of independence and stability for people other than ourselves ; whether we can continue to act with restraint when the temptation to " get it over with " is inviting but dangerous ; whether we can accept the necessity of choosing " a great evil in order to ward off a greater "; whether we can do these without arousing the hatreds and the passions that are ordinarily loosed in time of war -- on all these questions so much turns .
the answers will determine not only where we are , but " whither we are tending .
" a time of testing -- yes .
and a time of transition .
the transition is sometimes slow ; sometimes unpopular ; almost always very painful ; and often quite dangerous .
but we have lived with danger for a long time before , and we shall live with it for a long time yet to come .
we know that " man is born unto trouble .
" we also know that this nation was not forged and did not survive and grow and prosper without a great deal of sacrifice from a great many men .
for all the disorders that we must deal with , and all the frustrations that concern us , and all the anxieties that we are called upon to resolve , for all the issues we must face with the agony that attends them , let us remember that " those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must , like men , undergo the fatigues of supporting it .
" but let us also count not only our burdens but our blessings -- for they are many .
and let us give thanks to the one who governs us all .
let us draw encouragement from the signs of hope -- for they , too , are many .
let us remember that we have been tested before and america has never been found wanting .
so with your understanding , i would hope your confidence , and your support , we are going to persist -- and we are going to succeed .

president lyndon b. johnson 's annual message to the congress on the state of the union
january 17 , 1968
mr. speaker , mr. president , members of the congress , and my fellow americans : i was thinking as i was walking down the aisle tonight of what sam rayburn told me many years ago : the congress always extends a very warm welcome to the president -- as he comes in .
thank all of you very , very much .
i have come once again to this chamber -- the home of our democracy -- to give you , as the constitution requires , " information of the state of the union .
" i report to you that our country is challenged , at home and abroad :
-- that it is our will that is being tried , not our strength ; our sense of purpose , not our ability to achieve a better america ; -- that we have the strength to meet our every challenge ; the physical strength to hold the course of decency and compassion at home ; and the moral strength to support the cause of peace in the world .
and i report to you that i believe , with abiding conviction , that this people -- nurtured by their deep faith , tutored by their hard lessons , moved by their high aspirations -- have the will to meet the trials that these times impose .
since i reported to you last january :
-- three elections have been held in vietnam -- in the midst of war and under the constant threat of violence .
-- a president , a vice president , a house and senate , and village officials have been chosen by popular , contested ballot .
-- the enemy has been defeated in battle after battle .
-- the number of south vietnamese living in areas under government protection tonight has grown by more than a million since january of last year .
these are all marks of progress .
yet :
-- the enemy continues to pour men and material across frontiers and into battle , despite his continuous heavy losses .
-- he continues to hope that america 's will to persevere can be broken .
well -- he is wrong .
america will persevere .
our patience and our perseverance will match our power .
aggression will never prevail .
but our goal is peace -- and peace at the earliest possible moment .
right now we are exploring the meaning of hanoi 's recent statement .
there is no mystery about the questions which must be answered before the bombing is stopped .
we believe that any talks should follow the san antonio formula that i stated last september , which said :
-- the bombing would stop immediately if talks would take place promptly and with reasonable hopes that they would be productive .
-- and the other side must not take advantage of our restraint as they have in the past .
this nation simply cannot accept anything less without jeopardizing the lives of our men and of our allies .
if a basis for peace talks can be established on the san antonio foundations -- and it is my hope and my prayer that they can -- we would consult with our allies and with the other side to see if a complete cessation of hostilities -- a really true cease - fire -- could be made the first order of business .
i will report at the earliest possible moment the results of these explorations to the american people .
i have just recently returned from a very fruitful visit and talks with his holiness the pope and i share his hope -- as he expressed it earlier today -- that both sides will extend themselves in an effort to bring an end to the war in vietnam .
i have today assured him that we and our allies will do our full part to bring this about .
since i spoke to you last january , other events have occurred that have major consequences for world peace .
-- the kennedy round achieved the greatest reduction in tariff barriers in all the history of trade negotiations .
-- the nations of latin america at punta del este resolved to move toward economic integration .
-- in asia , the nations from korea and japan to indonesia and singapore worked behind america 's shield to strengthen their economies and to broaden their political cooperation .
-- in africa , from which the distinguished vice president has just returned , he reports to me that there is a spirit of regional cooperation that is beginning to take hold in very practical ways .
these events we all welcomed .
yet since i last reported to you , we and the world have been confronted by a number of crises :
-- during the arab - israeli war last june , the hot line between washington and moscow was used for the first time in our history .
a cease - fire was achieved without a major power confrontation .
now the nations of the middle east have the opportunity to cooperate with ambassador jarring 's u. n . mission and they have the responsibility to find the terms of living together in stable peace and dignity , and we shall do all in our power to help them achieve that result .
-- not far from this scene of conflict , a crisis flared on cyprus involving two peoples who are america 's friends : greece and turkey .
our very able representative , mr. cyrus vance , and others helped to ease this tension .
-- turmoil continues on the mainland of china after a year of violent disruption .
the radical extremism of their government has isolated the chinese people behind their own borders .
the united states , however , remains willing to permit the travel of journalists to both our countries ; to undertake cultural and educational exchanges ; and to talk about the exchange of basic food crop materials .
since i spoke to you last , the united states and the soviet union have taken several important steps toward the goal of international cooperation .
as you will remember , i met with chairman kosygin at glassboro and we achieved if not accord , at least a clearer understanding of our respective positions after 2 days of meeting .
because we believe the nuclear danger must be narrowed , we have worked with the soviet union and with other nations to reach an agreement that will halt the spread of nuclear weapons .
on the basis of communications from ambassador fisher in geneva this afternoon , i am encouraged to believe that a draft treaty can be laid before the conference in geneva in the very near future .
i hope to be able to present that treaty to the senate this year for the senate 's approval .
we achieved , in 1967 , a consular treaty with the soviets , the first commercial air agreement between the two countries , and a treaty banning weapons in outer space .
we shall sign , and submit to the senate shortly , a new treaty with the soviets and with others for the protection of astronauts .
serious differences still remain between us , yet in these relations , we have made some progress since vienna , the berlin wall , and the cuban missile crisis .
but despite this progress , we must maintain a military force that is capable of deterring any threat to this nation 's security , whatever the mode of aggression .
our choices must not be confined to total war -- or to total acquiescence .
we have such a military force today .
we shall maintain it .
i wish -- with all of my heart -- that the expenditures that are necessary to build and to protect our power could all be devoted to the programs of peace .
but until world conditions permit , and until peace is assured , america 's might -- and america 's bravest sons who wear our nation 's uniform -- must continue to stand guard for all of us -- as they gallantly do tonight in vietnam and other places in the world .
yet neither great weapons nor individual courage can provide the conditions of peace .
for two decades america has committed itself against the tyranny of want and ignorance in the world that threatens the peace .
we shall sustain that commitment .
this year i shall propose :
-- that we launch , with other nations , an exploration of the ocean depths to tap its wealth , and its energy , and its abundance .
-- that we contribute our fair share to a major expansion of the international development association , and to increase the resources of the asian development bank .
-- that we adopt a prudent aid program , rooted in the principle of self - help .
-- that we renew and extend the food for freedom program .
our food programs have already helped millions avoid the horrors of famine .
but unless the rapid growth of population in developing countries is slowed , the gap between rich and poor will widen steadily .
governments in the developing countries must take such facts into consideration .
we in the united states are prepared to help assist them in those efforts .
but we must also improve the lives of children already born in the villages and towns and cities on this earth .
they can be taught by great teachers through space communications and the miracle of satellite television -- and we are going to bring to bear every resource of mind and technology to help make this dream come true .
let me speak now about some matters here at home .
tonight our nation is accomplishing more for its people than has ever been accomplished before .
americans are prosperous as men have never been in recorded history .
yet there is in the land a certain restlessness -- a questioning .
the total of our nation 's annual production is now above $ 800 billion .
for 83 months this nation has been on a steady upward trend of growth .
all about them , most american families can see the evidence of growing abundance : higher paychecks , humming factories , new cars moving down new highways .
more and more families own their own homes , equipped with more than 70 million television sets .
a new college is founded every week .
today more than half of the high school graduates go on to college .
there are hundreds of thousands of fathers and mothers who never completed grammar school -- who will see their children graduate from college .
why , then , this restlessness ?
because when a great ship cuts through the sea , the waters are always stirred and troubled .
and our ship is moving .
it is moving through troubled and new waters ; it is moving toward new and better shores .
we ask now , not how can we achieve abundance ?-- but how shall we use our abundance ?
not , is there abundance enough for all ?-- but , how can all share in our abundance ?
while we have accomplished much , much remains for us to meet and much remains for us to master .
-- in some areas , the jobless rate is still three or four times the national average .
-- violence has shown its face in some of our cities .
-- crime increases on our streets .
-- income for farm workers remains far behind that for urban workers ; and parity for our farmers who produce our food is still just a hope -- not an achievement .
-- new housing construction is far less than we need -- to assure decent shelter for every family .
-- hospital and medical costs are high , and they are rising .
-- many rivers -- and the air in many cities -- remain badly polluted .
and our citizens suffer from breathing that air .
we have lived with conditions like these for many , many years .
but much that we once accepted as inevitable , we now find absolutely intolerable .
in our cities last summer , we saw how wide is the gulf for some americans between the promise and the reality of our society .
we know that we cannot change all of this in a day .
it represents the bitter consequences of more than three centuries .
but the issue is not whether we can change this ; the issue is whether we will change this .
well , i know we can .
and i believe we will .
this then is the work we should do in the months that are ahead of us in this congress .
the first essential is more jobs , useful jobs for tens of thousands who can become productive and can pay their own way .
our economy has created 7 1 / 2 million new jobs in the past 4 years .
it is adding more than a million and a half new jobs this year .
through programs passed by the congress , job training is being given tonight to more than a million americans in this country .
this year , the time has come when we must get to those who are last in line -- the hard - core unemployed -- the hardest to reach .
employment officials estimate that 500,000 of these persons are now unemployed in the major cities of america .
our objective is to place these 500,000 in private industry jobs within the next 3 years .
to do this , i propose a $ 2 . 1 billion manpower program in the coming fiscal year -- a 25 percent increase over the current year .
most of this increase will be used to start a new partnership between government and private industry to train and to hire the hard - core unemployed persons .
i know of no task before us of more importance to us , to the country , or to our future .
another essential is to rebuild our cities .
last year the congress authorized $ 662 million for the model cities program .
i requested the full amount of that authorization to help meet the crisis in the cities of america .
but the congress appropriated only $ 312 million -- less than half .
this year i urge the congress to honor my request for model cities funds to rebuild the centers of american cities by granting us the full amount that you in the congress authorized --$ 1 billion .
the next essential is more housing -- and more housing now .
surely a nation that can go to the moon can place a decent home within the reach of its families .
therefore we must call together the resources of industry and labor , to start building 300,000 housing units for low - and middle - income families next year -- that is three times more than this year .
we must make it possible for thousands of families to become homeowners , not rent - payers .
i propose , for the consideration of this congress , a 10 - year campaign to build 6 million new housing units for low - and middle - income families .
six million units in the next 10 years .
we have built 530,000 the last 10 years .
better health for our children -- all of our children -- is essential if we are to have a better america .
last year , medicare , medicaid , and other new programs that you passed in the congress brought better health to more than 25 million americans .
american medicine -- with the very strong support and cooperation of public resources - has produced a phenomenal decline in the death rate from many of the dread diseases .
but it is a shocking fact that , in saving the lives of babies , america ranks 15th among the nations of the world .
and among children , crippling defects are often discovered too late for any corrective action .
this is a tragedy that americans can , and americans should , prevent .
i shall , therefore , propose to the congress a child health program to provide , over the next 5 years , for families unable to afford it -- access to health services from prenatal care of the mother through the child 's first year .
when we do that you will find it is the best investment we ever made because we will get these diseases in their infancy and we will find a cure in a great many instances that we can never find by overcrowding our hospitals when they are grown .
now when we act to advance the consumer 's cause i think we help every american .
last year , with very little fanfare the congress and the executive branch moved in that field .
we enacted the wholesome meat act , the flammable fabrics act , the product safety commission , and a law to improve clinical laboratories .
and now , i think , the time has come to complete our unfinished work .
the senate has already passed the truth - in - lending bill , the fire safety bill , and the pipeline safety laws .
tonight i plead with the house to immediately act upon these measures and i hope take favorable action upon all of them .
i call upon the congress to enact , without delay , the remainder of the 12 vital consumer protection laws that i submitted to the congress last year .
i also urge final action on a measure that is already passed by the house to guard against fraud and manipulation in the nation 's commodity exchange market .
these measures are a pledge to our people -- to keep them safe in their homes and at work , and to give them a fair deal in the marketplace .
and i think we must do more .
i propose :
-- new powers for the federal trade commission to stop those who defraud and who swindle our public .
-- new safeguards to insure the quality of fish and poultry , and the safety of our community water supplies .
-- a major study of automobile insurance .
-- protection against hazardous radiation from television sets and other electronic equipment .
and to give the consumer a stronger voice , i plan to appoint a consumer counsel in the justice department -- a lawyer for the american consumer -- to work directly under the attorney general , to serve the president 's special assistant for consumer affairs , and to serve the consumers of this land .
this congress -- democrats and republicans -- can earn the thanks of history .
we can make this truly a new day for the american consumer , and by giving him this protection we can live in history as the consumer - conscious congress .
so let us get on with the work .
let us act soon .
we , at every level of the government , state , local , federal , know that the american people have had enough of rising crime and lawlessness in this country .
they recognize that law enforcement is first the duty of local police and local government .
they recognize that the frontline headquarters against crime is in the home , the church , the city hall and the county courthouse and the statehouse -- not in the far - removed national capital of washington .
but the people also recognize that the national government can and the national government should help the cities and the states in their war on crime to the full extent of its resources and its constitutional authority .
and this we shall do .
this does not mean a national police force .
it does mean help and financial support :
-- to develop state and local master plans to combat crime , -- to provide better training and better pay for police , and -- to bring the most advanced technology to the war on crime in every city and every county in america .
there is no more urgent business before this congress than to pass the safe streets act this year that i proposed last year .
that law will provide these required funds .
they are so critically needed that i have doubled my request under this act to $ 100 million in fiscal 1969 .
and i urge the congress to stop the trade in mail - order murder , to stop it this year by adopting a proper gun control law .
this year , i will propose a drug control act to provide stricter penalties for those who traffic in lsd and other dangerous drugs with our people .
i will ask for more vigorous enforcement of all of our drug laws by increasing the number of federal drug and narcotics control officials by more than 30 percent .
the time has come to stop the sale of slavery to the young .
i also request you to give us funds to add immediately 100 assistant united states attorneys throughout the land to help prosecute our criminal laws .
we have increased our judiciary by 40 percent and we have increased our prosecutors by 16 percent .
the dockets are full of cases because we do n't have assistant district attorneys to go before the federal judge and handle them .
we start these young lawyers at $ 8,200 a year .
and the docket is clogged because we do n't have authority to hire more of them .
i ask the congress for authority to hire 100 more .
these young men will give special attention to this drug abuse , too .
finally , i ask you to add 100 fbi agents to strengthen law enforcement in the nation and to protect the individual rights of every citizen .
a moment ago i spoke of despair and frustrated hopes in the cities where the fires of disorder burned last summer .
we can -- and in time we will -- change that despair into confidence , and change those frustrations into achievements .
but violence will never bring progress .
we can make progress only by attacking the causes of violence and only where there is civil order founded on justice .
today we are helping local officials improve their capacity to deal promptly with disorders .
those who preach disorder and those who preach violence must know that local authorities are able to resist them swiftly , to resist them sternly , and to resist them decisively .
i shall recommend other actions :
-- to raise the farmers ' income by establishing a security commodity reserve that will protect the market from price - depressing stocks and protect the consumer from food scarcity .
-- i shall recommend programs to help farmers bargain more effectively for fair prices .
-- i shall recommend programs for new air safety measures .
-- measures to stem the rising costs of medical care .
-- legislation to encourage our returning veterans to devote themselves to careers in community service such as teaching , and being firemen , and joining our police force , and our law enforcement officials .
-- i shall recommend programs to strengthen and finance our anti - pollution efforts .
-- fully funding all of the $ 2 . 18 billion poverty program that you in the congress had just authorized in order to bring opportunity to those who have been left far behind .
-- i shall recommend an educational opportunity act to speed up our drive to break down the financial barriers that are separating our young people from college .
i shall also urge the congress to act on several other vital pending bills -- especially the civil rights measures -- fair jury trials , protection of federal rights , enforcement of equal employment opportunity , and fair housing .
the unfinished work of the first session must be completed -- the higher education act , the juvenile delinquency act , conservation measures to save the redwoods of california , and to preserve the wonders of our scenic rivers , the highway beautification act -- and all the other measures for a cleaner , and for a better , and for a more beautiful america .
next month we ' ll begin our 8th year of uninterrupted prosperity .
the economic outlook for this year is one of steady growth -- if we are vigilant .
true , there are some clouds on the horizon .
prices are rising .
interest rates have passed the peak of 1966 ; and if there is continued inaction on the tax bill , they will climb even higher .
i warn the congress and the nation tonight that this failure to act on the tax bill will sweep us into an accelerating spiral of price increases , a slump in homebuilding , and a continuing erosion of the american dollar .
this would be a tragedy for every american family .
and i predict that if this happens , they will all let us know about it .
we -- those of us in the executive branch , in the congress , and the leaders of labor and business -- must do everything we can to prevent that kind of misfortune .
under the new budget , the expenditures for 1969 will increase by $ 10 . 4 billion .
receipts will increase by $ 22 . 3 billion including the added tax revenues .
virtually all of this expenditure increase represents the mandatory cost of our defense efforts , $ 3 billion ; increased interest , almost $ 1 billion ; or mandatory payments under laws passed by congress -- such as those provided in the social security act that you passed in 1967 , and to medicare and medicaid beneficiaries , veterans , and farmers , of about $ 4 1 / 2 billion ; and the additional $ 1 billion 600 million next year for the pay increases that you passed in military and civilian pay .
that makes up the $ 10 billion that is added to the budget .
with few exceptions , very few , we are holding the fiscal 1969 budget to last year 's level , outside of those mandatory and required increases .
a presidential commission composed of distinguished congressional fiscal leaders and other prominent americans recommended this year that we adopt a new budget approach .
i am carrying out their recommendations in this year 's budget .
this budget , therefore , for the first time accurately covers all federal expenditures and all federal receipts , including for the first time in one budget $ 47 billion from the social security , medicare , highway , and other trust funds .
the fiscal 1969 budget has expenditures of approximately $ 186 billion , with total estimated revenues , including the tax bill , of about $ 178 billion .
if the congress enacts the tax increase , we will reduce the budget deficit by some $ 12 billion .
the war in vietnam is costing us about $ 25 billion and we are asking for about $ 12 billion in taxes -- and if we get that $ 12 billion tax bill we will reduce the deficit from about $ 20 billion in 1968 to about $ 8 billion in 1969 .
now , this is a tight budget .
it follows the reduction that i made in cooperation with the congress -- a reduction made after you had reviewed every appropriations bill and reduced the appropriations by some $ 5 or $ 6 billion and expenditures by $ 1 . 5 billion .
we conferred together and i recommended to the congress and you subsequently approved taking 2 percent from payrolls and 10 percent from controllable expenditures .
we therefore reduced appropriations almost $ 10 billion last session and expenditures over $ 4 billion .
now , that was in the budget last year .
i ask the congress to recognize that there are certain selected programs that meet the nation 's most urgent needs and they have increased .
we have insisted that decreases in very desirable but less urgent programs be made before we would approve any increases .
so i ask the congress tonight :
-- to hold its appropriations to the budget requests , and -- to act responsibly early this year by enacting the tax surcharge which for the average american individual amounts to about a penny out of each dollar 's income .
this tax increase would yield about half of the $ 23 billion per year that we returned to the people in the tax reduction bills of 1964 and 1965 .
this must be a temporary measure , which expires in less than 2 years .
congress can repeal it sooner if the need has passed .
but congress can never repeal inflation .
the leaders of american business and the leaders of american labor -- those who really have power over wages and prices -- must act responsibly , and in their nation 's interest by keeping increases in line with productivity .
if our recognized leaders do not do this , they and those for whom they speak and all of us are going to suffer very serious consequences .
on january 1st , i outlined a program to reduce our balance of payments deficit sharply this year .
we will ask the congress to help carry out those parts of the program which require legislation .
we must restore equilibrium to our balance of payments .
we must also strengthen the international monetary system .
we have assured the world that america 's full gold stock stands behind our commitment to maintain the price of gold at $ 35 an ounce .
we must back this commitment by legislating now to free our gold reserves .
americans , traveling more than any other people in history , took $ 4 billion out of their country last year in travel costs .
we must try to reduce the travel deficit that we have of more than $ 2 billion .
we are hoping that we can reduce it by $ 500 million -- without unduly penalizing the travel of teachers , students , business people who have essential and necessary travel , or people who have relatives abroad whom they want to see .
even with this reduction of $ 500 million , the american people will still be traveling more overseas than they did in 1967 , 1966 , or 1965 or any other year in their history .
if we act together as i hope we can , i believe we can continue our economic expansion which has already broken all past records .
and i hope that we can continue that expansion in the days ahead .
each of these questions i have discussed with you tonight is a question of policy for our people .
therefore , each of them should be -- and doubtless will be -- debated by candidates for public office this year .
i hope those debates will be marked by new proposals and by a seriousness that matches the gravity of the questions themselves .
these are not appropriate subjects for narrow partisan oratory .
they go to the heart of what we americans are all about -- all of us , democrats and republicans .
tonight i have spoken of some of the goals i should like to see america reach .
many of them can be achieved this year -- others by the time we celebrate our nation 's 200th birthday -- the bicentennial of our independence .
several of these goals are going to be very hard to reach .
but the state of our union will be much stronger 8 years from now on our 200th birthday if we resolve to reach these goals now .
they are more important -- much more important -- than the identity of the party or the president who will then be in office .
these goals are what the fighting and our alliances are really meant to protect .
can we achieve these goals ?
of course we can -- if we will .
if ever there was a people who sought more than mere abundance , it is our people .
if ever there was a nation that was capable of solving its problems , it is this nation .
if ever there were a time to know the pride and the excitement and the hope of being an american -- it is this time .
so this , my friends , is the state of our union : seeking , building , tested many times in this past year -- and always equal to the test .
thank you and good night .
president lyndon b. johnson 's annual message to the congress on the state of the union
january 14 , 1969
mr. speaker , mr. president , members of the congress and my fellow , americans : for the sixth and the last time , i present to the congress my assessment of the state of the union .
i shall speak to you tonight about challenge and opportunity -- and about the commitments that all of us have made together that will , if we carry them out , give america our best chance to achieve the kind of great society that we all want .
every president lives , not only with what is , but with what has been and what could be .
most of the great events in his presidency are part of a larger sequence extending back through several years and extending back through several other administrations .
urban unrest , poverty , pressures on welfare , education of our people , law enforcement and law and order , the continuing crisis in the middle east , the conflict in vietnam , the dangers of nuclear war , the great difficulties of dealing with the communist powers , all have this much in common : they and their causes -- the causes that gave rise to them -- all of these have existed with us for many years .
several presidents have already sought to try to deal with them .
one or more presidents will try to resolve them or try to contain them in the years that are ahead of us .
but if the nation 's problems are continuing , so are this great nation 's assets :
-- our economy , -- the democratic system , -- our sense of exploration , symbolized most recently by the wonderful flight of the apollo 8 , in which all americans took great pride , -- the good commonsense and sound judgment of the american people , and -- their essential love of justice .
we must not ignore our problems .
but neither should we ignore our strengths .
those strengths are available to sustain a president of either party -- to support his progressive efforts both at home and overseas .
unfortunately , the departure of an administration does not mean the end of the problems that this administration has faced .
the effort to meet the problems must go on , year after year , if the momentum that we have all mounted together in these past years is not to be lost .
although the struggle for progressive change is continuous , there are times when a watershed is reached -- when there is -- if not really a break with the past -- at least the fulfillment of many of its oldest hopes , and a stepping forth into a new environment , to seek new goals .
i think the past 5 years have been such a time .
we have finished a major part of the old agenda .
some of the laws that we wrote have already , in front of our eyes , taken on the flesh of achievement .
medicare that we were unable to pass for so many years is now a part of american life .
voting rights and the voting booth that we debated so long back in the fifties , and the doors to public service , are open at last to all americans regardless of their color .
schools and school children all over america tonight are receiving federal assistance to go to good schools .
preschool education -- head start -- is already here to stay and , i think , so are the federal programs that tonight are keeping more than a million and a half of the cream of our young people in the colleges and the universities of this country .
part of the american earth -- not only in description on a map , but in the reality of our shores , our hills , our parks , our forests , and our mountains -- has been permanently set aside for the american public and for their benefit .
and there is more that will be set aside before this administration ends .
five million americans have been trained for jobs in new federal programs .
i think it is most important that we all realize tonight that this nation is close to full employment -- with less unemployment than we have had at any time in almost 20 years .
that is not in theory ; that is in fact .
tonight , the unemployment rate is down to 3 . 3 percent .
the number of jobs has grown more than 8 1 / 2 million in the last 5 years .
that is more than in all the preceding 12 years .
these achievements completed the full cycle , from idea to enactment and , finally , to a place in the lives of citizens all across this country .
i wish it were possible to say that everything that this congress and the administration achieved during this period had already completed that cycle .
but a great deal of what we have committed needs additional funding to become a tangible realization .
yet the very existence of these commitments -- these promises to the american people , made by this congress and by the executive branch of the government -- are achievements in themselves , and failure to carry through on our commitments would be a tragedy for this nation .
this much is certain : no one man or group of men made these commitments alone .
congress and the executive branch , with their checks and balances , reasoned together and finally wrote them into the law of the land .
they now have all the moral force that the american political system can summon when it acts as one .
they express america 's common determination to achieve goals .
they imply action .
in most cases , you have already begun that action -- but it is not fully completed , of course .
let me speak for a moment about these commitments .
i am going to speak in the language which the congress itself spoke when it passed these measures .
i am going to quote from your words .
in 1966 , congress declared that " improving the quality of urban life is the most critical domestic problem facing the united states .
" two years later it affirmed the historic goal of " a decent home .
.
.
for every american family .
" that is your language .
now to meet these commitments , we must increase our support for the model cities program , where blueprints of change are already being prepared in more than 150 american cities to achieve the goals of the housing act of 1968 that you have already passed , we should begin this year more than 500,000 homes for needy families in the coming fiscal year .
funds are provided in the new budget to do just this .
this is almost 10 times -- 10 times -- the average rate of the past 10 years .
our cities and our towns are being pressed for funds to meet the needs of their growing populations .
so i believe an urban development bank should be created by the congress .
this bank could obtain resources through the issuance of taxable bonds and it could then lend these resources at reduced rates to the communities throughout the land for schools , hospitals , parks , and other public facilities .
since we enacted the social security act back in 1935 , congress has recognized the necessity to " make more adequate provision for aged persons .
.
.
through maternal and child welfare .
.
.
and public health .
" those are the words of the congress --" more adequate .
" the time has come , i think , to make it more adequate .
i believe we should increase social security benefits , and i am so recommending tonight .
i am suggesting that there should be an overall increase in benefits of at least 13 percent .
those who receive only the minimum of $ 55 should get $ 80 a month .
our nation , too , is rightfully proud of our medical advances .
but we should remember that our country ranks 15th among the nations of the world in its infant mortality rate .
i think we should assure decent medical care for every expectant mother and for their children during the first year of their life in the united states of america .
i think we should protect our children and their families from the costs of catastrophic illness .
as we pass on from medicine , i think nothing is clearer to the congress than the commitment that the congress made to end poverty .
congress expressed it well , i think , in 1964 , when they said : " it is the policy of the united states to eliminate the paradox of poverty in the midst of plenty in this nation .
" this is the richest nation in the world .
the antipoverty program has had many achievements .
it also has some failures .
but we must not cripple it after only 3 years of trying to solve the human problems that have been with us and have been building up among us for generations .
i believe the congress this year will want to improve the administration of the poverty program by reorganizing portions of it and transferring them to other agencies .
i believe , though , it will want to continue , until we have broken the back of poverty , the efforts we are now making throughout this land .
i believe , and i hope the next administration -- i believe they believe -- that the key to success in this effort is jobs .
it is work for people who want to work .
in the budget for fiscal 1970 , i shall recommend a total of $ 3 . 5 billion for our job training program , and that is five times as much as we spent in 1964 trying to prepare americans where they can work to earn their own living .
the nation 's commitment in the field of civil rights began with the declaration of independence .
they were extended by the 13th , 14th , and 15th amendments .
they have been powerfully strengthened by the enactment of three far - reaching civil rights laws within the past 5 years , that this congress , in its wisdom , passed .
on january 1 of this year , the fair housing act of 1968 covered over 20 million american homes and apartments .
the prohibition against racial discrimination in that act should be remembered and it should be vigorously enforced throughout this land .
i believe we should also extend the vital provisions of the voting rights act for another 5 years .
in the safe streets act of 1968 , congress determined " to assist state and local governments in reducing the incidence of crime .
" this year i am proposing that the congress provide the full $ 300 million that the congress last year authorized to do just that .
i hope the congress will put the money where the authorization is .
i believe this is an essential contribution to justice and to public order in the united states .
i hope these grants can be made to the states and they can be used effectively to reduce the crime rate in this country .
but all of this is only a small part of the total effort that must be made -- i think chiefly by the local governments throughout the nation -- if we expect to reduce the toll of crime that we all detest .
frankly , as i leave the office of the presidency , one of my greatest disappointments is our failure to secure passage of a licensing and registration act for firearms .
i think if we had passed that act , it would have reduced the incidence of crime .
i believe that the congress should adopt such a law , and i hope that it will at a not too distant date .
in order to meet our long - standing commitment to make government as efficient as possible , i believe that we should reorganize our postal system along the lines of the kappel1 report .
i hope we can all agree that public service should never impose an unreasonable financial sacrifice on able men and women who want to serve their country .
i believe that the recommendations of the commission on executive , legislative and judicial salaries are generally sound .
later this week , i shall submit a special message which i reviewed with the leadership this evening containing a proposal that has been reduced and has modified the commission 's recommendation to some extent on the congressional salaries .
for members of congress , i will recommend the basic compensation not of the $ 50,000 unanimously recommended by the kappel commission and the other distinguished members , but i shall reduce that $ 50,000 to $ 42,500 .
i will suggest that congress appropriate a very small additional allowance for official expenses , so that members will not be required to use their salary increase for essential official business .
i would have submitted the commission 's recommendations , except the advice that i received from the leadership -- and you usually are consulted about matters that affect the congress -- was that the congress would not accept the $ 50,000 recommendation , and if i expected my recommendation to be seriously considered , i should make substantial reductions .
that is the only reason i didn ' t go along with the kappel report .
in 1967 i recommended to the congress a fair and impartial random selection system for the draft .
i submit it again tonight for your most respectful consideration .
i know that all of us recognize that most of the things we do to meet all of these commitments i talk about will cost money .
if we maintain the strong rate of growth that we have had in this country for the past 8 years , i think we shall generate the resources that we need to meet these commitments .
we have already been able to increase our support for major social programs -- although we have heard a lot about not being able to do anything on the home front because of vietnam ; but we have been able in the last 5 years to increase our commitments for such things as health and education from $ 30 billion in 1964 to $ 68 billion in the coming fiscal year .
that is more than double .
that is more than it has ever been increased in the 188 years of this republic , notwithstanding vietnam .
we must continue to budget our resources and budget them responsibly in a way that will preserve our prosperity and will strengthen our dollar .
greater revenues and the reduced federal spending required by congress last year have changed the budgetary picture dramatically since last january when we made our estimates .
at that time , you will remember that we estimated we would have a deficit of $ 8 billion .
well , i am glad to report to you tonight that the fiscal year ending june 30 , 1969 , this june , we are going to have not a deficit , but we are going to have a $ 2 . 4 billion surplus .
you will receive the budget tomorrow .
the budget for the next fiscal year , that begins july 1 -- which you will want to examine very carefully in the days ahead -- will provide a $ 3 . 4 billion surplus .
this budget anticipates the extension of the surtax that congress enacted last year .
i have communicated with the president - elect , mr. nixon , in connection with this policy of continuing the surtax for the time being .
i want to tell you that both of us want to see it removed just as soon as circumstances will permit , but the president - elect has told me that he has concluded that until his administration , and this congress , can examine the appropriation bills , and each item in the budget , and can ascertain that the facts justify permitting the surtax to expire or to be reduced , he , mr. nixon , will support my recommendation that the surtax be continued .
americans , i believe , are united in the hope that the paris talks will bring an early peace to vietnam .
and if our hopes for an early settlement of the war are realized , then our military expenditures can be reduced and very substantial savings can be made to be used for other desirable purposes , as the congress may determine .
in any event , i think it is imperative that we do all that we responsibly can to resist inflation while maintaining our prosperity .
i think all americans know that our prosperity is broad and it is deep , and it has brought record profits , the highest in our history , and record wages .
our gross national product has grown more in the last 5 years than any other period in our nation 's history .
our wages have been the highest .
our profits have been the best .
this prosperity has enabled millions to escape the poverty that they would have otherwise had the last few years .
i think also you will be very glad to hear that the secretary of the treasury informs me tonight that in 1968 in our balance of payments we have achieved a surplus .
it appears that we have , in fact , done better this year than we have done in any year in this regard since the year 1957 .
the quest for a durable peace , i think , has absorbed every administration since the end of world war ii .
it has required us to seek a limitation of arms races not only among the superpowers , but among the smaller nations as well .
we have joined in the test ban treaty of 1963 , the outer space treaty of 1967 , and the treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons in 1968 .
this latter agreement -- the nonproliferation treaty -- is now pending in the senate and it has been pending there since last july .
in my opinion , delay in ratifying it is not going to be helpful to the cause of peace .
america took the lead in negotiating this treaty and america should now take steps to have it approved at the earliest possible date .
until a way can be found to scale down the level of arms among the superpowers , mankind cannot view the future without fear and great apprehension .
so , i believe that we should resume the talks with the soviet union about limiting offensive and defensive missile systems .
i think they would already have been resumed except for czechoslovakia and our election this year .
it was more than 20 years ago that we embarked on a program of trying to aid the developing nations .
we knew then that we could not live in good conscience as a rich enclave on an earth that was seething in misery .
during these years there have been great advances made under our program , particularly against want and hunger , although we are disappointed at the appropriations last year .
we thought they were woefully inadequate .
this year i am asking for adequate funds for economic assistance in the hope that we can further peace throughout the world .
i think we must continue to support efforts in regional cooperation .
among those efforts , that of western europe has a very special place in america 's concern .
the only course that is going to permit europe to play the great world role that its resources permit is to go forward to unity .
i think america remains ready to work with a united europe , to work as a partner on the basis of equality .
for the future , the quest for peace , i believe , requires :
-- that we maintain the liberal trade policies that have helped us become the leading nation in world trade , -- that we strengthen the international monetary system as an instrument of world prosperity , and -- that we seek areas of agreement with the soviet union where the interests of both nations and the interests of world peace are properly served .
the strained relationship between us and the world 's leading communist power has not ended -- especially in the light of the brutal invasion of czechoslovakia .
but totalitarianism is no less odious to us because we are able to reach some accommodation that reduces the danger of world catastrophe .
what we do , we do in the interest of peace in the world .
we earnestly hope that time will bring a russia that is less afraid of diversity and individual freedom .
the quest for peace tonight continues in vietnam , and in the paris talks .
i regret more than any of you know that it has not been possible to restore peace to south vietnam .
the prospects , i think , for peace are better today than at any time since north vietnam began its invasion with its regular forces more than 4 years ago .
the free nations of asia know what they were not sure of at that time : that america cares about their freedom , and it also cares about america 's own vital interests in asia and throughout the pacific .
the north vietnamese know that they cannot achieve their aggressive purposes by force .
there may be hard fighting before a settlement is reached ; but , i can assure you , it will yield no victory to the communist cause .
i cannot speak to you tonight about vietnam without paying a very personal tribute to the men who have carried the battle out there for all of us .
i have been honored to be their commander in chief .
the nation owes them its unstinting support while the battle continues -- and its enduring gratitude when their service is done .
finally , the quest for stable peace in the middle east goes on in many capitals tonight .
america fully supports the unanimous resolution of the u. n. security council which points the way .
there must be a settlement of the armed hostility that exists in that region of the world today .
it is a threat not only to israel and to all the arab states , but it is a threat to every one of us and to the entire world as well .
now , my friends in congress , i want to conclude with a few very personal words to you .
i rejected and rejected and then finally accepted the congressional leadership 's invitation to come here to speak this farewell to you in person tonight .
i did that for two reasons .
one was philosophical .
i wanted to give you my judgment , as i saw it , on some of the issues before our nation , as i view them , before i leave .
the other was just pure sentimental .
most all of my life as a public official has been spent here in this building .
for 38 years -- since i worked on that gallery as a doorkeeper in the house of representatives -- i have known these halls , and i have known most of the men pretty well who walked them .
i know the questions that you face .
i know the conflicts that you endure .
i know the ideals that you seek to serve .
i left here first to become vice president , and then to become , in a moment of tragedy , the president of the united states .
my term of office has been marked by a series of challenges , both at home and throughout the world .
in meeting some of these challenges , the nation has found a new confidence .
in meeting others , it knew turbulence and doubt , and fear and hate .
throughout this time , i have been sustained by my faith in representative democracy -- a faith that i had learned here in this capitol building as an employee and as a congressman and as a senator .
i believe deeply in the ultimate purposes of this nation -- described by the constitution , tempered by history , embodied in progressive laws , and given life by men and women that have been elected to serve their fellow citizens .
now for 5 most demanding years in the white house , i have been strengthened by the counsel and the cooperation of two great former presidents , harry s. truman and dwight david eisenhower .
i have been guided by the memory of my pleasant and close association with the beloved john f. kennedy , and with our greatest modern legislator , speaker sam rayburn .
i have been assisted by my friend every step of the way , vice president hubert humphrey .
i am so grateful that i have been supported daily by the loyalty of speaker mccormack and majority leader albert .
i have benefited from the wisdom of senator mike mansfield , and i am sure that i have avoided many dangerous pitfalls by the good commonsense counsel of the president pro tem of the senate , senator richard brevard russell .
i have received the most generous cooperation from the leaders of the republican party in the congress of the united states , senator dirksen and congressman gerald ford , the minority leader .
no president should ask for more , although i did upon occasions .
but few presidents have ever been blessed with so much .
president - elect nixon , in the days ahead , is going to need your understanding , just as i did .
and he is entitled to have it .
i hope every member will remember that the burdens he will bear as our president , will be borne for all of us .
each of us should try not to increase these burdens for the sake of narrow personal or partisan advantage .
now , it is time to leave .
i hope it may be said , a hundred years from now , that by working together we helped to make our country more just , more just for all of its people , as well as to insure and guarantee the blessings of liberty for all of our posterity .
that is what i hope .
but i believe that at least it will be said that we tried .
annual message to the congress on the state of the union .
january 22 , 1970
mr. speaker , mr. president , my colleagues in the congress , our distinguished guests and my fellow americans : to address a joint session of the congress in this great chamber in which i was once privileged to serve is an honor for which i am deeply grateful .
the state of the union address is traditionally an occasion for a lengthy and detailed account by the president of what he has accomplished in the past , what he wants the congress to do in the future , and , in an election year , to lay the basis for the political issues which might be decisive in the fall .
occasionally there comes a time when profound and far - reaching events command a break with tradition .
this is such a time .
i say this not only because 1970 marks the beginning of a new decade in which america will celebrate its 200th birthday .
i say it because new knowledge and hard experience argue persuasively that both our programs and our institutions in america need to be reformed .
the moment has arrived to harness the vast energies and abundance of this land to the creation of a new american experience , an experience richer and deeper and more truly a reflection of the goodness and grace of the human spirit .
the seventies will be a time of new beginnings , a time of exploring both on the earth and in the heavens , a time of discovery .
but the time has also come for emphasis on developing better ways of managing what we have and of completing what man 's genius has begun but left unfinished .
our land , this land that is ours together , is a great and a good land .
it is also an unfinished land , and the challenge of perfecting it is the summons of the seventies .
it is in that spirit that i address myself to those great issues facing our nation which are above partisanship .
when we speak of america 's priorities the first priority must always be peace for america and the world .
the major immediate goal of our foreign policy is to bring an end to the war in vietnam in a way that our generation will be remembered -- not so much as the generation that suffered in war , but more for the fact that we had the courage and character to win the kind of a just peace that the next generation was able to keep .
we are making progress toward that goal .
the prospects for peace are far greater today than they were a year ago .
a major part of the credit for this development goes to the members of this congress who , despite their differences on the conduct of the war , have overwhelmingly indicated their support of a just peace .
by this action , you have completely demolished the enemy 's hopes that they can gain in washington the victory our fighting men have denied them in vietnam .
no goal could be greater than to make the next generation the first in this century in which america was at peace with every nation in the world .
i shall discuss in detail the new concepts and programs designed to achieve this goal in a separate report on foreign policy , which i shall submit to the congress at a later date .
today , let me describe the directions of our new policies .
we have based our policies on an evaluation of the world as it is , not as it was 25 years ago at the conclusion of world war ii .
many of the policies which were necessary and right then are obsolete today .
then , because of america 's overwhelming military and economic strength , because of the weakness of other major free world powers and the inability of scores of newly independent nations to defend , or even govern , themselves , america had to assume the major burden for the defense of freedom in the world .
in two wars , first in korea and now in vietnam , we furnished most of the money , most of the arms , most of the men to help other nations defend their freedom .
today the treat industrial nations of europe , as well as japan , have regained their economic strength ; and the nations of latin america -- and many of the nations who acquired their freedom from colonialism after world war ii in asia and africa -- have a new sense of pride and dignity and a determination to assume the responsibility for their own defense .
that is the basis of the doctrine i announced at guam .
1 neither the defense nor the development of other nations can be exclusively or primarily an american undertaking .
the nations of each part of the world should assume the primary responsibility for their own well - being ; and they themselves should determine the terms of that well - being .
we shall be faithful to our treaty commitments , but we shall reduce our involvement and our presence in other nations  affairs .
to insist that other nations play a role is not a retreat from responsibility ; it is a sharing of responsibility .
the result of this new policy has been not to weaken our alliances , but to give them new life , new strength , a new sense of common purpose .
relations with our european allies are once again strong and healthy , based on mutual consultation and mutual responsibility .
we have initiated a new approach to latin america in which we deal with those nations as partners rather than patrons .
the new partnership concept has been welcomed in asia .
we have developed a historic new basis for japanese - american friendship and cooperation , which is the linchpin for peace in the pacific .
if we are to have peace in the last third of the century , a major factor will be the development of a new relationship between the united states and the soviet union .
i would not underestimate our differences , but we are moving with precision and purpose from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiation .
our negotiations on strategic arms limitations and in other areas will have far greater chance for success if both sides enter them motivated by mutual self - interest rather than na ? ve sentimentality .
it is with this same spirit that we have resumed discussions with communist china in our talks at warsaw .
our concern in our relations with both these nations is to avoid a catastrophic collision and to build a solid basis for peaceful settlement of our differences .
i would be the last to suggest that the road to peace is not difficult and dangerous , but i believe our new policies have contributed to the prospect that america may have the best chance since world war ii to enjoy a generation of uninterrupted peace .
and that chance will be enormously increased if we continue to have a relationship between congress and the executive in which , despite differences in detail , where the security of america and the peace of mankind are concerned , we act not as republicans , not as democrats , but as americans .
as we move into the decade of the seventies , we have the greatest opportunity for progress at home of any people in world history .
our gross national product will increase by $ 500 billion in the next 10 years .
this increase alone is greater than the entire growth of the american economy from 1790 to 1950 .
the critical question is not whether we will grow , but how we will use that growth .
the decade of the sixties was also a period of great growth economically .
but in that same 10 - year period we witnessed the greatest growth of crime , the greatest increase in inflation , the greatest social unrest in america in 100 years .
never has a nation seemed to have had more and enjoyed it less .
at heart , the issue is the effectiveness of government .
ours has become -- as it continues to be , and should remain -- a society of large expectations .
government helped to generate these expectations .
it undertook to meet them .
yet , increasingly , it proved unable to do so .
as a people , we had too many visions -- and too little vision .
now , as we enter the seventies , we should enter also a great age of reform of the institutions of american government .
our purpose in this period should not be simply better management of the programs of the past .
the time has come for a new quest -- a quest not for a greater quantity of what we have , but for a new quality of life in america .
a major part of the substance for an unprecedented advance in this nation 's approach to its problems and opportunities is contained in more than two score legislative proposals which i sent to the congress last year and which still await enactment .
i will offer at least a dozen more major programs in the course of this session .
at this point i do not intend to go through a detailed listing of what i have proposed or will propose , but i would like to mention three areas in which urgent priorities demand that we move and move now : first , we cannot delay longer in accomplishing a total reform of our welfare system .
when a system penalizes work , breaks up homes , robs recipients of dignity , there is no alternative to abolishing that system and adopting in its place the program of income support , job training , and work incentives which i recommended to the congress last year .
second , the time has come to assess and reform all of our institutions of government at the federal , state , and local level .
it is time for a new federalism , in which , after 190 years of power flowing from the people and local and state governments to washington , d. c ., it will begin to flow from washington back to the states and to the people of the united states .
third , we must adopt reforms which will expand the range of opportunities for all americans .
we can fulfill the american dream only when each person has a fair chance to fulfill his own dreams .
this means equal voting rights , equal employment opportunity , and new opportunities for expanded ownership .
because in order to be secure in their human rights , people need access to property rights .
i could give similar examples of the need for reform in our programs for health , education , housing , transportation , as well as other critical areas which directly affect the well - being of millions of americans .
the people of the united states should wait no longer for these reforms that would so deeply enhance the quality of their life .
when i speak of actions which would be beneficial to the american people , i can think of none more important than for the congress to join this administration in the battle to stop the rise in the cost of living .
now , i realize it is tempting to blame someone else for inflation .
some blame business for raising prices .
some blame unions for asking for more wages .
but a review of the stark fiscal facts of the 1960 's clearly demonstrates where the primary blame for rising prices must be placed .
in the decade of the sixties the federal government spent $ 57 billion more than it took in in taxes .
in the same decade the american people paid the bill for that deficit in price increases which raised the cost of living for the average family of four by $ 200 per month in america .
now millions of americans are forced to go into debt today because the federal government decided to go into debt yesterday .
we must balance our federal budget so that american families will have a better chance to balance their family budgets .
only with the cooperation of the congress can we meet this highest priority objective of responsible government .
we are on the right track .
we had a balanced budget in 1969 .
this administration cut more than $ 7 billion out of spending plans in order to produce a surplus in 1970 , and in spite of the fact that congress reduced revenues by $ 3 billion , i shall recommend a balanced budget for 1971 .
but i can assure that not only to present , but to stay within , a balanced budget requires some very hard decisions .
it means rejecting spending programs which would benefit some of the people when their net effect would result in price increases for all the people .
it is time to quit putting good money into bad programs .
otherwise , we will end up with bad money and bad programs .
i recognize the political popularity of spending programs , and particularly in an election year .
but unless we stop the rise in prices , the cost of living for millions of american families will become unbearable and government 's ability to plan programs for progress for the future will become impossible .
in referring to budget cuts , there is one area where i have ordered an increase rather than a cut -- and that is the requests of those agencies with the responsibilities for law enforcement .
we have heard a great deal of overblown rhetoric during the sixties in which the word `` war '' has perhaps too often been used -- the war on poverty , the war on misery , the war on disease , the war on hunger .
but if there is one area where the word `` war '' is appropriate it is in the fight against crime .
we must declare and win the war against the criminal elements which increasingly threaten our cities , our homes , and our lives .
we have a tragic example of this problem in the nation 's capital , for whose safety the congress and the executive have the primary responsibility .
i doubt if many members of this congress who live more than a few blocks from here would dare leave their cars in the capitol garage and walk home alone tonight .
last year this administration sent to the congress 13 separate pieces of legislation dealing with organized crime , pornography , street crime , narcotics , crime in the district of columbia .
none of these bills has reached my desk for signature .
i am confident that the congress will act now to adopt the legislation i placed before you last year .
we in the executive have done everything we can under existing law , but new and stronger weapons are needed in that fight .
while it is true that state and local law enforcement agencies are the cutting edge in the effort to eliminate street crime , burglaries , murder , my proposals to you have embodied my belief that the federal government should play a greater role in working in partnership with these agencies .
that is why 1971 federal spending for local law enforcement will double that budgeted for 1970 .
the primary responsibility for crimes that affect individuals is with local and state rather than with federal government .
but in the field of organized crime , narcotics , pornography , the federal government has a special responsibility it should fulfill .
and we should make washington , d. c ., where we have the primary responsibility , an example to the nation and the world of respect for law rather than lawlessness .
i now turn to a subject which , next to our desire for peace , may well become the major concern of the american people in the decade of the seventies .
in the next 10 years we shall increase our wealth by 50 percent .
the profound question is : does this mean we will be 50 percent richer in a real sense , 50 percent better off , 50 percent happier ?
or does it mean that in the year 1980 the president standing in this place will look back on a decade in which 70 percent of our people lived in metropolitan areas chocked by traffic , suffocated by smog , poisoned by water , deafened by noise , and terrorized by crime ?
these are not the great questions that concern world leaders at summit conferences .
but people do not live at the summit .
they live in the foothills of everyday experience , and it is time for all of us to concern ourselves with the way real people live in real life .
the great question of the seventies is , shall we surrender to our surroundings , or shall we make our peace with nature and begin to make reparations for the damage we have done to our air , to our land , and to our water ?
restoring nature to its natural state is a cause beyond party and beyond factions .
it has become a common cause of all the people of this country .
it is a cause of particular concern to young americans , because they more than we will reap the grim consequences of our failure to act on programs which are needed now if we are to prevent disaster later .
clean air , clean water , open spaces -- these should once again be the birthright of every american .
if we act now , they can be .
we still think of air as free .
but clean air is not free , and neither is clean water .
the price tag on pollution control is high .
through our years of past carelessness we incurred a debt to nature , and now that debt is being called .
the program i shall propose to congress will be the most comprehensive and costly program in this field in america 's history .
it is not a program for just one year .
a year 's plan in this field is no plan at all .
this is a time to look ahead not a year , but 5 years or 10 years -- whatever time is required to do the job .
i shall propose to this congress a $ 10 billion nationwide clean waters program to put modern municipal waste treatment plants in every place in america where they are needed to make our waters clean again , and do it now .
we have the industrial capacity , if we begin now , to build them all within 5 years .
this program will get them built within 5 years .
as our cities and suburbs relentlessly expand , those priceless open spaces needed for recreation areas accessible to their people are swallowed up -- often forever .
unless we preserve these spaces while they are still available , we will have none to preserve .
therefore , i shall propose new financing methods for purchasing open space and parklands now , before they are lost to us .
the automobile is our worst polluter of the air .
adequate control requires further advances in engine design and fuel composition .
we shall intensify our research , set increasingly strict standards , and strengthen enforcement procedures -- and we shall do it now .
we can no longer afford to consider air and water common property , free to be abused by anyone without regard to the consequences .
instead , we should begin now to treat them as scarce resources , which we are no more free to contaminate than we are free to throw garbage into our neighbor 's yard .
this requires comprehensive new regulations .
it also requires that , to the extent possible , the price of goods should be made to include the costs of producing and disposing of them without damage to the environment .
now , i realize that the argument is often made that there is a fundamental contradiction between economic growth and the quality of life , so that to have one we must forsake the other .
the answer is not to abandon growth , but to redirect it .
for example , we should turn toward ending congestion and eliminating smog the same reservoir of inventive genius that created them in the first place .
continued vigorous economic growth provides us with the means to enrich life itself and to enhance our planet as a place hospitable to man .
each individual must enlist in this fight if it is to be won .
it has been said that no matter how many national parks and historical monuments we buy and develop , the truly significant environment for each of us is that in which we spend 80 percent of our time -- in our homes , in our places of work , the streets over which we travel .
street litter , rundown parking strips and yards , dilapidated fences , broken windows , smoking automobiles , dingy working places , all should be the object of our fresh view .
we have been too tolerant of our surroundings and too willing to leave it to others to clean up our environment .
it is time for those who make massive demands on society to make some minimal demands on themselves .
each of us must resolve that each day he will leave his home , his property , the public places of the city or town a little cleaner , a little better , a little more pleasant for himself and those around him .
with the help of people we can do anything , and without their help , we can do nothing .
in this spirit , together , we can reclaim our land for ours and generations to come .
between now and the year 2000 , over 100 million children will be born in the united states .
where they grow up -- and how -- will , more than any one thing , measure the quality of american life in these years ahead .
this should be a warning to us .
for the past 30 years our population has also been growing and shifting .
the result is exemplified in the vast areas of rural america emptying out of people and of promise -- a third of our countries lost population in the sixties .
the violent and decayed central cities of our great metropolitan complexes are the most conspicuous area of failure in american life today .
i propose that before these problems become insoluble , the nation develop a national growth policy .
in the future , government decisions as to where to build highways , locate airports , acquire land , or sell land should be made with a clear objective of aiding a balanced growth for america .
in particular , the federal government must be in a position to assist in the building of new cities and the rebuilding of old ones .
at the same time , we will carry our concern with the quality of life in america to the farm as well as the suburb , to the village as well as to the city .
what rural america needs most is a new kind of assistance .
it needs to be dealt with , not as a separate nation , but as part of an overall growth policy for america .
we must create a new rural environment which will not only stem the migration to urban centers , but reverse it .
if we seize our growth as a challenge , we can make the 1970 's a historic period when by conscious choice we transformed our land into what we want it to become .
america , which has pioneered in the new abundance , and in the new technology , is called upon today to pioneer in meeting the concerns which have followed in their wake -- in turning the wonders of science to the service of man .
in the majesty of this great chamber we hear the echoes of america 's history , of debates that rocked the union and those that repaired it , of the summons to war and the search for peace , of the uniting of the people , the building of a nation .
those echoes of history remind us of our roots and our strengths .
they remind us also of that special genius of american democracy , which at one critical turning point after another has led us to spot the new road to the future and given us the wisdom and the courage to take it .
as i look down that new road which i have tried to map out today , i see a new america as we celebrate our 200th anniversary 6 years from now .
i see an america in which we have abolished hunger , provided the means for every family in the nation to obtain a minimum income , made enormous progress in providing better housing , faster transportation , improved health , and superior education .
i see an america in which we have checked inflation , and waged a winning war against crime .
i see an america in which we have made great strides in stopping the pollution of our air , cleaning up our water , opening up our parks , continuing to explore in space .
most important , i see an america at peace with all the nations of the world .
this is not an impossible dream .
these goals are all within our reach .
in times past , our forefathers had the vision but not the means to achieve such goals .
let it not be recorded that we were the first american generation that had the means but not the vision to make this dream come true .
but let us , above all , recognize a fundamental truth .
we can be the best clothed , best fed , best housed people in the world , enjoying clean air , clean water , beautiful parks , but we could still be the unhappiest people in the world without an indefinable spirit -- the lift of a driving dream which has made america , from its beginning , the hope of the world .
two hundred years ago this was a new nation of 3 million people , weak militarily , poor economically .
but america meant something to the world then which could not be measured in dollars , something far more important than military might .
listen to president thomas jefferson in 1802 : we act not `` for ourselves along , but for the whole human race .'' we had a spiritual quality then which caught the imagination of millions of people in the world .
today , when we are the richest and strongest nation in the world , let it not be recorded that we lack the moral and spiritual idealism which made us the hope of the world at the time of our birth .
the demands of us in 1976 are even greater than in 1776 .
it is no longer enough to live and let live .
now we must live and help live .
we need a fresh climate in america , one in which a person can breathe freely and breathe in freedom .
our recognition of the truth that wealth and happiness are not the same thing requires us to measure success or failure by new criteria .
even more than the programs i have described today , what this nation needs is an example from its elected leaders in providing the spiritual and moral leadership which no programs for material progress can satisfy .
above all , let us inspire young americans with a sense of excitement , a sense of destiny , a sense of involvement , in meeting the challenges we face in this great period of our history .
only then are they going to have any sense of satisfaction in their lives .
the greatest privilege an individual can have is to serve in a cause bigger than himself .
we have such a cause .
how we seize the opportunities i have described today will determine not only our future , but the future of peace and freedom in this world in the last third of the century .
may god give us the wisdom , the strength and , above all , the idealism to be worthy of that challenge , so that america can fulfill its destiny of being the world 's best hope for liberty , for opportunity , for progress and peace for all peoples .
note : the president delivered his address at 12 : 30 p . m . in the house chamber at the capitol before a joint session of the congress .
he was introduced by speaker of the house of representatives john w. mccormack of massachusetts .
on the same day an advance text of the president 's address was released by the white house press office .
annual message to the congress on the state of the union .
january 22 , 1971 mr. speaker , mr. president , my colleagues in the congress , our distinguished guests , my fellow americans : as this 92d congress begins its session , america has lost a great senator , and all of us who had the privilege to know him have lost a loyal friend .
i had the privilege of visiting senator russell in the hospital just a few days before he died .
he never spoke about himself .
he only spoke eloquently about the need for a strong national defense .
in tribute to one of the most magnificent americans of all time , i respectfully ask that all those here will rise in silent prayer for senator russell .
@[ moment of silence ] thank you .
mr. speaker , before i begin my formal address , i want to use this opportunity to congratulate all of those who were winners in the rather spirited contest for leadership positions in the house and the senate and , also , to express my condolences to the losers .
i know how both of you feel .
and i particularly want to join with all of the members of the house and the senate as well in congratulating the new speaker of the united states congress .
to those new members of this house who may have some doubts about the possibilities for advancement in the years ahead , i would remind you that the speaker and i met just 24 years ago in this chamber as freshmen members of the 80th congress .
as you see , we both have come up in the world a bit since then .
mr. speaker , this 92d congress has a chance to be recorded as the greatest congress in america 's history .
in these troubled years just past , america has been going through a long nightmare of war and division , of crime and inflation .
even more deeply , we have gone through a long , dark night of the american spirit .
but now that night is ending .
now we must let our spirits soar again .
now we are ready for the lift of a driving dream .
the people of this nation are eager to get on with the quest for new greatness .
they see challenges , and they are prepared to meet those challenges .
it is for us here to open the doors that will set free again the real greatness of this nation -- the genius of the american people .
how shall we meet this challenge ?
how can we truly open the doors , and set free the full genius of our people ?
the way in which the 92d congress answers these questions will determine its place in history .
more importantly , it can determine this nation 's place in history as we enter the third century of our independence .
tonight i shall present to the congress six great goals .
i shall ask not simply for more new programs in the old framework .
i shall ask to change the framework of government itself -- to reform the entire structure of american government so we can make it again fully responsive to the needs and the wishes of the american people .
if we act boldly -- if we size this moment and achieve these goals -- we can close the gap between promise and performance in american government .
we can bring together the resources of this nation and the spirit of the american people .
in discussing these great goals , i shall deal tonight only with matters on the domestic side of the nation 's agenda .
i shall make a separate report to the congress and the nation next month on developments in foreign policy .
the first of these great goals is already before the congress .
i urge that the unfinished business of the 91st congress be made the first priority business of the 92d congress .
over the next 2 weeks , i will call upon congress to take action on more than 35 pieces of proposed legislation on which action was not completed last year .
the most important is welfare reform .
the present welfare system has become a monstrous , consuming outrage -- an outrage against the community , against the taxpayer , and particularly against the children it is supposed to help .
we may honestly disagree , as we do , on what to do about it .
but we can all agree that we must meet the challenge , not by pouring more money into a bad program , but by abolishing the present welfare system and adopting a new one .
so let us place a floor under the income of every family with children in america -- and without those demeaning , soul - stifling affronts to human dignity that so blight the lives of welfare children today .
but let us also establish an effective work incentive and an effective work requirement .
let us provide the means by which more can help themselves .
this shall be our goal .
let us generously help those who are not able to help themselves .
but let us stop helping those who are able to help themselves but refuse to do so .
the second great goal is to achieve what americans have not enjoyed since 1957 -- full prosperity in peacetime .
the tide of inflation has turned .
the rise in the cost of living , which had been gathering dangerous momentum in the late sixties , was reduced last year .
inflation will be further reduced this year .
but as we have moved from runaway inflation toward reasonable price stability and at the same time as we have been moving from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy , we have paid a price in increased unemployment .
we should take no comfort from the fact that the level of unemployment in this transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy is lower than in any peacetime year of the sixties .
this is not good enough for the man who is unemployed in the seventies .
we must do better for workers in peacetime and we will do better .
to achieve this , i will admit an expansionary budget this year -- one that will help stimulate the economy and thereby open up new job opportunities for millions of americans .
it will be a full employment budget , a budget designed to be in balance if the economy were operating at its peak potential .
by spending as if we were at full employment , we will help to bring about full employment .
i ask the congress to accept these expansionary policies -- to accept the concept of a full employment budget .
at the same time , i ask the congress to cooperate in resisting expenditures that go beyond the limits of the full employment budget .
for as we wage a campaign to bring about a widely shared prosperity , we must not reignite the fires of inflation and so undermine that prosperity .
with the stimulus and the discipline of a full employment budget , with the commitment of the independent federal reserve system to provide fully for the monetary needs of a growing economy , and with a much greater effort on the part of labor and management to make their wage and price decisions in the light of the national interest and their own self - interest -- then for the worker , the farmer , the consumer , for americans everywhere we shall gain the goal of a new prosperity : more jobs , more income , more profits , without inflation and without war .
this is a great goal , and once that we can achieve together .
the third great goal is to continue the effort so dramatically begun last year : to restore and enhance our natural environment .
building on the foundation laid in the 37 - point program that i submitted to congress last year , i will propose a strong new set of initiatives to clean up our air and water , to combat noise , and to preserve and restore our surroundings .
i will propose programs to make better use of our land , to encourage a balanced national growth -- growth that will revitalize our rural heartland and enhance the quality of life in america .
and not only to meet today 's needs but to anticipate those of tomorrow , i will put forward the most extensive program ever proposed by a president of the united states to expand the nation 's parks , recreation areas , open spaces , in a way that truly brings parks to the people where the people are .
for only if we leave a legacy of parks will the next generation have parks to enjoy .
as a fourth great goal , i will offer a far - reaching set of proposals for improving america 's health care and making it available more fairly to more people .
i will propose : -- a program to insure that no american family will be prevented from obtaining basic medical care by inability to pay .
-- i will propose a major increase in and redirection of aid to medical schools , to greatly increase the number of doctors and other health personnel .
-- incentives to improve the delivery of health services , to get more medical care resources into those areas that have not been adequately served , to make greater use of medical assistants , and to slow the alarming rise in the costs of medical care .
-- new programs to encourage better preventive medicine , by attacking the causes of disease and injury , and by providing incentives to doctors to keep people well rather than just to treat them when they are sick .
i will also ask for an appropriation of an extra $ 100 million to launch an intensive campaign to find a cure for cancer , and i will ask later for whatever additional funds can effectively be used .
the time has come in america when the same kind of concentrated effort that split the atom and took man to the moon should be turned toward conquering this dread disease .
let us make a total national commitment to achieve this goal .
america has long been the wealthiest nation in the world .
now it is time we became the healthiest nation in the world .
the fifth great goal is to strengthen and to renew our state and local governments .
as we approach our 200th anniversary in 1976 , we remember that this nation launched itself as a loose confederation of separate states , without a workable central government .
at that time , the mark of its leaders  vision was that they quickly saw the need to balance the separate powers of the states with a government of central powers .
and so they gave us a constitution of balanced powers , of unity with diversity -- and so clear was their vision that it survives today as the oldest written constitution still in force in the world .
for almost two centuries since -- and dramatically in the 1990 's -- at those great turning points when the question has been between the states and the federal government , that question has been resolved in favor of a stronger central federal government .
during this time the nation grew and the nation prospered .
but one thing history tells us is that no great movement goes in the same direction forever .
nations change , they adapt , or they slowly die .
the time has now come in america to reverse the flow of power and resources from the states and communities to washington , and start power and resources flowing back from washington to the states and communities and , more important , to the people all across america .
the time has come for a new partnership between the federal government and the states and localities -- a partnership in which we entrust the states and localities with a large share of the nation 's responsibilities , and in which we share our federal revenues with them so that they can meet those responsibilities .
to achieve this goal , i propose to the congress tonight that we enact a plan of revenue sharing historic in scope and bold in concept .
all across america today , states and cities are confronted with a financial crisis .
some have already been cutting back on essential services -- for example , just recently san diego and cleveland cut back on trash collections .
most are caught between the prospects of bankruptcy on the one hand and adding to an already crushing tax burden on the other .
as one indication of the rising costs of local government , i discovered the other day that my home town of whittier , california -- which has a population of 67,000 -- has a larger budget for 1971 than the entire federal budget was in 1791 .
now the time has come to take a new direction , and once again to introduce a new and more creative balance to our approach to government .
so let us put the money where the needs are .
and let us put the power to spend it where the people are .
i propose that the congress make a $ 16 billion investment in renewing state and local government .
five billion dollars of this will be in new and unrestricted funds to be used as the states and localities see fit .
the other $ 11 billion will be provided by allocating $ 1 billion of new funds and converting one - third of the money going to the present narrow - purpose aid programs into federal revenue sharing funds for six broad purposes -- for urban development , rural development , education , transportation , job training , and law enforcement -- but with the states and localities making their own decisions on how it should be spent within each category .
for the next fiscal year , this would increase total federal aid to the states and localities more than 25 percent over the present level .
the revenue sharing proposals i send to the congress will include the safeguards against discrimination that accompany all other federal funds allocated to the states .
neither the president nor the congress nor the conscience of this nation can permit money which comes from all the people to be used in a way which discriminates against some of the people .
the federal government will still have a large and vital role to play in achieving our national progress .
established functions that are clearly and essentially federal in nature will still be performed by the federal government .
new functions that need to be sponsored or performed by the federal government -- such as those i have urged tonight in welfare and health -- will be added to the federal agenda .
whenever it makes the best sense for us to act as a whole nation , the federal government should and will lead the way .
but where states or local governments can better do what needs to be done , let us see that they have the resources to do it there .
under this plan , the federal government will provide the states and localities with more money and less interference -- and by cutting down the interference the same amount of money will go a lot further .
let us share our resources .
let us share them to rescue the states and localities from the brink of financial crisis .
let us share them to give homeowners and wage earners a chance to escape from ever - higher property taxes and sales taxes .
let us share our resources for two other reasons as well .
the first of these reasons has to do with government itself , and the second has to do with each of us , with the individual .
let 's face it .
most americans today are simply fed up with government at all levels .
they will not -- and they should not -- continue to tolerate the gap between promise and performance in government .
the fact is that we have made the federal government so strong it grows musclebound and the states and localities so weak they approach impotence .
if we put more power in more places , we can make government more creative in more places .
that way we multiply the number of people with the ability to make things happen -- and we can open the way to a new burst of creative energy throughout america .
the final reason i urge this historic shift is much more personal , for each and for every one of us .
as everything seems to have grown bigger and more complex in america , as the forces that shape our lives seem to have grown more distant and more impersonal , a great feeling of frustration has crept across this land .
whether it is the workingman who feels neglected , the black man who feels oppressed , or the mother concerned about her children , there has been a growing feeling the `` things are in the saddle , and ride mankind .'' millions of frustrated young americans today are crying out -- asking not what will government do for me , but what can i do , how can i contribute , how can i matter ?
and so let us answer them .
let us say to them and let us say to all americans , `` we hear you .
we will give you a chance .
we are going to give you a new chance to have more to say about the decisions that affect your future -- a chance to participate in government -- because we are going to provide more centers of power where what you do can make a difference that you can see and feel in your own life and the life of your whole community .'' the further away government is from people , the stronger government becomes and the weaker people become .
and a nation with a strong government and a weak people is an empty shell .
i reject the patronizing idea that government in washington , d. c ., is inevitably more wise , more honest , and more efficient than government at the local or state level .
the honesty and efficiency of government depends on people .
government at all level has good people and bad people .
and the way to get more good people into government is to give them more opportunity to do good things .
the idea that a bureaucratic elite in washington knows best what is best for people everywhere and that you cannot trust local governments is really a contention that you cannot trust people to govern themselves .
this notion is completely foreign to the american experience .
local government is the government closest to the people , it is most responsive to the individual person .
it is people 's government in a far more intimate way than the government in washington can ever be .
people came to america because they wanted to determine their own future rather than to live in a country where others determined their future for them .
more people a chance to do something , we can have government that truly is by the people .
and by setting up a completely modern , functional system of government at the national level , we in washington will at last be able to provide government that is truly for the people .
i realize that what i am asking is that not only the executive branch in washington but that even this congress will have to change by giving up some of its power .
change is hard .
but without change there can be no progress .
and for each of us the question then becomes , not `` will change cause me inconvenience ?'' but `` will change bring progress for america ?'' giving up power is hard .
but i would urge all of you , as leaders of this country , to remember that the truly revered leaders in world history are those who gave power to people , and not those who took it away .
as we consider these reforms we will be acting , not for the next 2 years or for the next 10 years , but for the next 100 years .
so let us approach these six great goals with a sense not only of this moment in history but also of history itself .
let us act with the willingness to work together and the vision and the boldness and the courage of those great americans who met in philadelphia almost190 years ago to write a constitution .
let us leave a heritage as they did -- not just for our children but for millions yet unborn -- of a nation where every american will have a chance not only to live in peace and to enjoy prosperity and opportunity but to participate in a system of government where he knows not only his votes but his ideas count -- a system of government which will provide the means for america to reach heights of achievement undreamed of before .
those men who met at philadelphia left a great heritage because they had a vision -- not only of what the nation was but of what it could become .
as i think of that vision , i recall that america was founded as the land of the open door -- as a haven for the oppressed , a land of opportunity , a place of refuge , of hope .
when the first settlers opened the door of america three and a half centuries ago , they came to escape persecution and to find opportunity -- and they left wide the door of welcome for others to follow .
when the thirteen colonies declared their independence almost two centuries ago , they opened the door to a new vision of liberty and of human fulfillment -- not just for an elite but for all .
to the generations that followed , america 's was the open door that beckoned millions from the old world to the new in search of a better life , a freer life , a fuller life , and in which , but their own decisions , they could shape their own destinies .
for the black american , the indian , the mexican - american , and for those others in our land who have not had an equal chance , the nation at last has begun to confront the need to press open the door of full and equal opportunity , and of human dignity .
for all americans , with these changes i have proposed tonight we can open the door to a new era of opportunity .
we can open the door to full and effective participation in the decisions that affect their lives .
we can open the door to a new partnership among governments at all levels , between those governments and the people themselves .
and by so doing , we can open wide the doors of human fulfillment for millions of people here in america now and in the years to come .
in the next few weeks i will spell out in greater detail the way i propose that we achieve these six great goals .
i ask this congress to be responsive .
if it is , then the 92d congress , your congress , our congress , at the end of its term , will be able to look back on a record more splendid than any in our history .
this can be the congress that helped us end the longest war in the nation 's history , and end it in a way that will give us at last a genuine chance to enjoy what we have not had in this century : a full generation of peace .
this can be the congress that helped achieve an expanding economy , with full employment and without inflation -- and without the deadly stimulus of war .
this can be the congress that reformed a welfare system that has robbed recipients of their dignity and robbed states and cities of their resources .
this can be the congress that pressed forward the rescue of our environment , and established for the next generation an enduring legacy of parks for the people .
this can be the congress that launched a new era in american medicine , in which the quality of medical care was enhanced while the costs were made less burdensome .
but above all , what this congress can be remembered for is opening the way to a new american revolution -- a peaceful revolution in which power was turned back to the people -- in which government at all levels was refreshed and renewed and made truly responsive .
this can be a revolution as profound , as far - reaching , as exciting as that first revolution almost 200 year ago -- and it can mean that just 5 years from now america will enter its third century as a young nation new in spirit , with all the vigor and the freshness with which it began its first century .
my colleagues in the congress , these are great goals .
they can make the sessions of this congress a great moment for america .
so let us pledge together to go forward together -- by achieving these goals to give america the foundation today for a new greatness tomorrow and in all the years to come , and in so doing to make this the greatest congress in the history of this great and good country .
note : the president delivered his address at 9 p . m . in the house chamber at the capitol before a joint session of the congress .
he was introduced by speaker of the house of representatives carl albert of oklahoma .
the address was broadcast live on radio and television .
an advance text of the president 's address was released on the same day .
the white house also released the transcripts of three news briefings on the president 's state of the union proposals : the first , on january 25 , 1971 , by senator hugh scott and representative gerald r. ford following a republican congressional leadership meeting with the president ; the second , on january 27 , by john d. khrlichman , assistant to the president for domestic affairs ; and the their , on february 2 , by secretary of commence maurice h. stans , secretary of labor james d. hedgson , nad secretary of agriculture clifford m. hardin following a meeting of the cabinet .
address on the state of the union delivered before a joint session of the congress .
january 20 , 1972
mr. speaker , mr. president , my colleagues in the congress , our distinguished guests , my fellow americans : twenty - five years ago i sat here as a freshman congressman -- along with speaker albert -- and listened for the first time to the president address the state of the union .
i shall never forget that moment .
the senate , the diplomatic corps , the supreme court , the cabinet entered the chamber , and then the president of the united states .
as all of you are aware , i had some differences with president truman .
he had some with me .
but i remember that on that day -- the day he addressed that joint session of the newly elected republican 80th congress , he spoke not as a partisan , but as president of all the people -- calling upon the congress to put aside partisan considerations in the national interest .
the greek - turkish aid program , the marshall plan , the great foreign policy initiatives which have been responsible for avoiding a world war for over 25 years were approved by the 80th congress , by a bipartisan majority of which i was proud to be a part .
nineteen hundred seventy - two is now before us .
it holds precious time in which to accomplish good for the nation .
we must not waste it .
i know the political pressures in this session of the congress will be great .
there are more candidates for the presidency in this chamber today than there probably have been at any one time in the whole history of the republic .
and there is an honest difference of opinion , not only between the parties , but within each party , on some foreign policy issues and on some domestic policy issues .
however , there are great national problems that are so vital that they transcend partisanship .
so let us have our debates .
let us have our honest differences .
but let us join in keeping the national interest first .
let us join in making sure that legislation the nation needs does not become hostage to the political interests of any party or any person .
there is ample precedent , in this election year , for me to present you with a huge list of new proposals , knowing full well that there would not be any possibility of your passing them if you worked night and day .
i shall not do that .
i have presented to the leaders of the congress today a message of 15,000 words discussing in some detail where the nation stands and setting forth specific legislative items on which i have asked the congress to act .
much of this is legislation which i proposed in 1969 , in 1970 , and also in the first session of this 92d congress and on which i feel it is essential that action be completed this year .
i am not presenting proposals which have attractive labels but no hope of passage .
i am presenting only vital programs which are within the capacity of this congress to enact , within the capacity of the budget to finance , and which i believe should be above partisanship -- programs which deal with urgent priorities for the nation , which should and must be the subject of bipartisan action by this congress in the interests of the country in 1972 .
when i took the oath of office on the steps of this building just 3 years ago today , the nation was ending one of the most tortured decades in its history .
the 1960 's were a time of great progress in many areas .
but as we all know , they were also times of great agony -- the agonies of war , of inflation , of rapidly rising crime , of deteriorating cities , of hopes raised and disappointed , and of anger and frustration that led finally to violence and to the worst civil disorder in a century .
i recall these troubles not to point any fingers of blame .
the nation was so torn in those final years of the sixties that many in both parties questioned whether america could be governed at all .
the nation has made significant progress in these first years of the seventies : our colleges and universities have again become places of learning instead of battlegrounds .
a beginning has been made in preserving and protecting our environment .
the rate of increase in crime has been slowed -- and here in the district of columbia , the one city where the federal government has direct jurisdiction , serious crime in 1971 was actually reduced by 13 percent from that year before .
most important , because of the beginnings that have been made , we can say today that this year 1972 can be the year in which america may make the greatest progress in 25 years toward achieving our goal of being at peace with all the nations of the world .
as our involvement in the war in vietnam comes to an end , we must now go on to build a generation of peace .
to achieve that goal , we must first face realistically the need to maintain our defense .
in the past 3 years , we have reduced the burden of arms .
for the first time in 20 years , spending on defense has been brought below spending on human resources .
as we look to the future , we find encouraging progress in our negotiations with the soviet union on limitation of strategic arms .
and looking further into the future , we hope there can eventually be agreement on the mutual reduction of arms .
but until there is such a mutual agreement , we must maintain the strength necessary to deter war .
and that is why , because of rising research and development costs , because of increases in military and civilian pay , because of the need to proceed with new weapons systems , my budget for the coming fiscal year will provide for an increase in defense spending .
strong military defenses are not the enemy of peace ; they are the guardians of peace .
there could be no more misguided set of priorities than one which would tempt others by weakening america , and thereby endanger the peace of the world .
in our foreign policy , we have entered a new era .
the world has changed greatly in the 11 years since president john kennedy said in his inaugural address , `` kwe shall pay any price , bear any burden , meet any hardship , support any friend , oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty .'' our policy has been carefully and deliberately adjusted to meet the new realities of the new world we live in .
we make today only those commitments we are able and prepared to meet .
our commitment to freedom remains strong and unshakable .
but others must bear their share of the burden of defending freedom around the world .
and so this , then , is our policy : -- we will maintain a nuclear deterrent adequate to meet any threat to the security of the united states or of our allies .
-- we will help other nations develop the capability of defending themselves .
-- we will faithfully honor all of our treaty commitments .
-- we will act to defend our interests , whenever and wherever they are threatened anyplace in the world .
-- but where our interests or our treaty commitments are not involved , our role will be limited .
-- we will not intervene militarily .
-- but we will use our influence to prevent war .
-- if war comes , we will use our influence to stop it .
-- once it is over , will do your share in helping to bind up the wounds of those who have participated in it .
as you know , i will soon be visiting the people 's republic of china and the soviet union .
i go there with no illusions .
we have great differences with both powers .
we shall continue to have great differences .
but peace depends on the ability of great powers to live together on the same planet despite their differences .
we would not be true to our obligation to generations yet unborn if we failed to seize this moment to do everything in our power to insure that we will be able to talk about those differences , rather than to fight about them , in the future .
as we look back over this century , let us , in the highest spirit of bipartisanship , recognize that we can be proud of our nation 's record in foreign affairs .
america has given more generously of itself toward maintaining freedom , preserving peace , alleviating human suffering around the globe , than any nation has ever done in the history of man .
we have fought four wars in this century , but our power has never been used to break the peace , only to keep it ; never been used to destroy freedom , only to defend it ; never been used to destroy freedom , only to defend it .
we now have within our reach the goal of insuring that the next generation can be the first generation in this century to be spared the scourges of war .
turning to our problems at home , we are making progress toward our goal of a new prosperity without war .
industrial production , consumer spending , retail sales , personal income all have been rising .
total employment , real income are the highest in history .
new homebuilding starts this past year reached the highest level ever .
business and consumer confidence have both been rising .
interest rates are down .
the rate of inflation is down .
we can look with confidence to 1972 as the year when the back of inflation will be broken .
now , this a good record , but it is not good enough -- not when we still have an unemployment rate of 6 percent .
it is not enough to point out that this was the rate of the early peacetime years of the sixties , or that if the more than 2 million men released from the armed forces and defense - related industries were still in their wartime jobs , unemployment would be far lower .
our goal in this country is full employment in peacetime .
we intend to meet that goal , and we can .
the congress has helped to meet that goal by passing our job - creating tax program last month .
the historic monetary agreements , agreements that we have reached with the major european nations , canada , and japan , will help meet it by providing new markets for american products , new jobs for american workers .
our budget will help meet it by being expansionary without being inflationary -- a job - producing budget that will help take up the gap as the economy expands to full employment .
our program to raise farm income will help meet it by helping to revitalize rural america , by giving to america 's farmers their fair share of america 's increasing productivity .
we also will help meet our goal of full employment in peacetime with a set of major initiatives to stimulate more imaginative use of america 's great capacity for technological advance , and to direct it toward improving the quality of life for every american .
in reaching the moon , we demonstrated what miracles american technology is capable of achieving .
now the time has come to move more deliberately toward making full use of that technology here on earth , of harnessing the wonders of science to the service of man .
i shall soon send to the congress a special message proposing a new program of federal partnership in technological research and developments -- with federal incentives to increase private research , federally supported research on projects designed to improve our everyday lives in ways that will range from improving mass transit to developing new systems of emergency health care that could save thousands of lives annually .
historically , our superior technology and high productivity have made it possible for american workers to be the highest paid in the world by far , and yet for our goods still to compete in world markets .
now we face a new situation .
as other nations move rapidly forward in technology , the answer to the new competition is not to build a wall around america , but rather to remain competitive by improving our own technology still further and by increasing productivity in american industry .
our new monetary and trade agreements will make it possible for american goods to compete fairly in the world 's markets -- but they still must compete .
the new technology program will put to use the skills of many highly trained americans , skills that might otherwise be wasted .
it will also meet the growing technological challenge from abroad , and it will thus help to create new industries , as well as creating more jobs for america 's workers in producing for the world 's markets .
this second session of the 92d congress already has before it more than 90 major administration proposals which still await action .
i have discussed these in the extensive written message that i have presented to the congress today .
they include , among others , our programs to improve life for the aging ; to combat crime and drug abuse ; to improve health services and to ensure that no one will be denied needed health care because of inability to pay ; to protect workers  pension rights ; to promote equal opportunity for members of minorities , and others who have been left behind ; to expand consumer protection ; to improve the environment ; to revitalize rural america ; to help the cities ; to launch new initiatives in education ; to improve transportation , and to put and end to costly labor tie - ups in transportation .
the west coast dock strike is a case in point .
this nation cannot and will not tolerate that kind of irresponsible labor tie - up in the future .
the messages also include basic reforms which are essential if our structure of government is to be adequate in the decades ahead .
they include reform of our wasteful and outmoded welfare system -- substitution of a new system that provides work requirements and work incentives for those who can help themselves , income support for those who cannot help themselves , and fairness to the working poor .
they include a $ 17 billion program of federal revenue sharing with the states and localities as an investment in their renewal , an investment also of faith in the american people .
they also include a sweeping reorganization of the executive branch of the federal government so that it will be more efficient , more responsive , and able to meet the challenges of the decades ahead .
one year ago , standing in this place , i laid before the opening session of this congress six great goals .
one of these was welfare reform .
that proposal has been before the congress now for nearly 2 1 / 2 years .
my proposals on revenue sharing , government reorganization , health care , and the environment have now been before the congress for nearly a year .
many of the other major proposals that i have referred to have been here that long or longer .
now , 1971 , we can say , was a year of consideration of these measures .
now let us join in making 1972 a year of action on them , action by the congress , for the nation and for the people of america .
now , in addition , there is one pressing need which i have not previously covered , but which must be placed on the national agenda .
we long have looked in this nation to the local property tax as the main source of financing for public primary and secondary education .
as a result , soaring school costs , soaring property tax rates now threaten both our communities and our schools .
they threaten communities because property taxes , which more than doubled in the 10 years from 1960 to 70 , have become one of the most oppressive and discriminatory of all taxes , hitting most cruelly at the elderly and the retired ; and they threaten schools , as hard - pressed voters understandably reject new bond issues at the polls .
the problem has been given even greater urgency by four recent court decisions , which have held that the conventional method of financing schools through local property taxes is discriminatory and unconstitutional .
nearly 2 years ago , i named a special presidential commission to study the problems of school finance , and i also directed the federal departments to look into the same problems .
we are developing comprehensive proposals to meet these problems .
this issue involves two complex and interrelated sets of problems : support of the schools and the basic relationships of federal , state , and local governments in any tax reforms .
under the leadership of the secretary of the treasury , we are carefully reviewing all of the tax aspects , and i have this week enlisted the advisory commission on intergovernmental relations in addressing the intergovernmental relations aspects .
i have asked this bipartisan commission to review our proposals for federal action to cope with the gathering crisis of school finance and property taxes .
later in the year , when both commissions have completed their studies , i shall make my final recommendations for relieving the burden of property taxes and providing both fair and adequate financing for our children 's education .
these recommendations will be revolutionary .
but all these recommendations , however , will be rooted in one fundamental principle with which there can be no compromise : local school boards must have control over local schools .
as we look ahead over the coming decades , vast new growth and change are not only certainties , they will be the dominant reality of this world , and particularly of our life in america .
surveying the certainty of rapid change , we can be like a fallen rider caught in the stirrups -- or we can sit high in the saddle , the masters of change , directing it on a course we choose .
the secret of mastering change in today 's world is to reach back to old and proven principles , and to adapt them with imagination and intelligence to the new realities of a new age .
that is what we have done in the proposals that i have laid before the congress .
they are rooted in basic principles that are as enduring as human nature , as robust as the american experience ; and they are responsive to new conditions .
thus they represent a spirit of change that is truly renewal .
as we look back at those old principles , we find them as timely as they are timeless .
we believe in independence , and self - reliance , and the creative value of the competitive spirit .
we believe in full and equal opportunity for all americans and in the protection of individual rights and liberties .
we believe in the family as the keystone of the community , and in the community as the keystone of the nation .
we believe in compassion toward those in need .
we believe in a system of law , justice , and order as the basis of a genuinely free society .
we believe that a person should get what he works for -- and that those who can , should work for -- and that those who can , should work for what they get .
we believe in the capacity of people to make their own decisions in their own lives , in their own communities -- and we believe in their right to make those decisions .
in applying these principles , we have done so with the full understanding that what we seek in the seventies , what our quest is , is not merely for more , but for better -- for a better quality of life for all americans .
thus , for example , we are giving a new measure of attention to cleaning up our air and water , making our surroundings more attractive .
we are providing broader support for the arts , helping stimulate a deeper appreciation of what they can contribute to the nation 's activities and to our individual lives .
but nothing really matters more to the quality of our lives than the way we treat one another , than our capacity to live respectfully together as a unified society , with a full , generous regard for the rights of others and also for the feelings of others .
as we recover from the turmoil and violence of recent years , as we learn once again to speak with one another instead of shouting at one another , we are regaining that capacity .
as is customary here , on this occasion , i have been talking about programs .
programs are important .
but even more important than programs is what we are as a nation -- what we mean as a nation , to ourselves and to the world .
in new york harbor stands one of the most famous statues in the world -- the statue of liberty , the gift in 1886 of the people of france to the people of the united states .
this statue is more than a landmark ; it is a symbol -- a symbol of what america has meant to the world .
it reminds us that what america has meant is not its wealth , and not its power , but its spirit and purpose -- a land that enshrines liberty and opportunity , and that has held out a hand of welcome to millions in search of a better and a fuller and , above all , a freer life .
the world 's hopes poured into america , along with its people .
and those hopes , those dreams , that have been brought here from every corner of the world , have become a part of the hope that we now hold out to the world .
four years from now , america will celebrate the 200th anniversary of its founding as a nation .
there are those who say that the old spirit of  76 is dead -- that we no longer have the strength of character , the idealism , the faith in our founding purposes that that spirit represents .
those who say this do not know america .
we have been undergoing self - doubts and self - criticism .
but these are only the other side of our growing sensitivity to the persistence of want in the midst of plenty , of our impatience with the slowness with which age - old ills are being overcome .
if we were indifferent to the shortcomings of our society , or complacent about our institutions , or blind to the lingering inequities -- then we would have lost our way .
but the fact that we have those concerns is evidence that our ideals , deep down , are still strong .
indeed , they remind us that what is really best about america is its compassion .
they remind us that in the final analysis , america is great not because it is rich , but because this is a good country .
let us reject the narrow visions of those who would tell us that we are evil because we are not yet perfect , that we are corrupt because we are not yet pure , that all the sweat and trial and sacrifice that have gone into the building of america were for naught because the building is not yet done .
let us see that the path we are traveling is wide , with room in it for all of us , and that its direction is toward a better nation and a more peaceful world .
never has it mattered more that we go forward together .
look at this chamber .
the leadership of america is here today -- the supreme court , the cabinet , the senate , the house of representatives .
together , we hold the future of the nation , and the conscience of the nation in our hands .
because this year is an election year , it will be a time of great pressure .
if we yield to that pressure and fail to deal seriously with the historic challenges that we face , we will have failed that trust of millions of americans and shaken the confidence they have a right to place in us , in their government .
never has a congress had a greater opportunity to leave a legacy of a profound and constructive reform for the nation than this congress .
if we succeed in these tasks , there will be credit enough for all -- not only for doing what is right , but doing it in the right way , by rising above partisan interest to serve the national interest .
and if we fail , more than any one of us , america will be the loser .
that is why my call upon the congress today is for a high statesmanship , so that in the years to come americans will look back and say because it withstood the intense pressures of a political year , and achieved such great good for the american people and for the future of this nation , this was truly a great congress .
note : the president spoke at 12 : 34 p . m . in the house chamber at the capitol , after being introduced by carl albert , speaker of the house of representatives .
the address was broadcast live on radio and television .
the president spoke from a prepared text .
an advance text of his address was released on the same day .
state of the union message to the congress : overview and goals .
february 2 , 1973
to the congress of the united states : the traditional form of the president 's annual report giving `` to the congress information of the state of the union '' is a single message or address .
as the affairs and concerns of our union have multiplied over the years , however , so too have the subjects that require discussion in state of the union messages .
this year in particular , with so many changes in government programs under consideration -- and with our very philosophy about the relationship between the individual and the state at an historic crossroads -- a single , all - embracing state of the union message would not appear to be adequate .
i have therefore decided to present my 1973 state of the union report in the form of a series of messages during these early weeks of the 93rd congress .
the purpose of this first message in the series is to give a concise overview of where we stand as a people today , and to outline some of the general goals that i believe we should pursue over the next year and beyond .
in coming weeks , i will send to the congress further state of the union reports on specific areas of policy including economic affairs , natural resources , human resources , community development and foreign and defense policy .
the new course these messages will outline represents a fresh approach to government : an approach that addresses the realities of the 1970s , not those of the 1930s or of the 1960s .
the role of the federal government as we approach our third century of independence should not be to dominate any facet of american life , but rather to aid and encourage people , communities and institutions to deal with as many of the difficulties and challenges facing them as possible , and to help see to it that every american has a full and equal opportunity to realize his or her potential .
if we were to continue to expand the federal government at the rate of the past several decades , it soon would consume us entirely .
the time has come when we must make clear choices -- choices between old programs that set worthy goals but failed to reach them and new programs that provide a better way to realize those goals ; and choices , too , between competing programs -- all of which may be desirable in themselves but only some of which we can afford with the finite resources at our command .
because our resources are not infinite , we also face a critical choice in 1973 between holding the line in government spending and adopting expensive programs which will surely force up taxes and refuel inflation .
finally , it is vital at this time that we restore a greater sense of responsibility at the state and local level , and among individual americans .
where we stand
the basic state of our union today is sound , and full of promise .
we enter 1973 economically strong , militarily secure and , most important of all , at peace after a long and trying war .
america continues to provide a better and more abundant life for more of its people than any other nation in the world .
we have passed through one of the most difficult periods in our history without surrendering to despair and without dishonoring our ideals as a people .
looking back , there is a lesson in all this for all of us .
the lesson is one that we sometimes had to learn the hard way over the past few years .
but we did learn it .
that lesson is that even potentially destructive forces can be converted into positive forces when we know how to channel them , and when we use common sense and common decency to create a climate of mutual respect and goodwill .
by working together and harnessing the forces of nature , americans have unlocked some of the great mysteries of the universe .
men have walked the surface of the moon and soared to new heights of discovery .
this same spirit of discovery is helping us to conquer disease and suffering that have plagued our own planet since the dawn of time .
by working together with the leaders of other nations , we have been able to build a new hope for lasting peace -- for a structure of world order in which common interest outweighs old animosities , and in which a new generation of the human family can grow up at peace in a changing world .
at home , we have learned that by working together we can create prosperity without fanning inflation ; we can restore order without weakening freedom .
the challenges we face
these first years of the 1970s have been good years for america .
our job -- all of us together -- is to make 1973 and the years to come even better ones .
i believe that we can .
i believe that we can make the years leading to our bicentennial the best four years in american history .
but we must never forget that nothing worthwhile can be achieved without the will to succeed and the strength to sacrifice .
hard decisions must be made , and we must stick by them .
in the field of foreign policy , we must remember that a strong america -- an america whose word is believed and whose strength is respected -- is essential to continued peace and understanding in the world .
the peace with honor we have achieved in vietnam has strengthened this basic american credibility .
we must act in such a way in coming years that this credibility will remain intact , and with it , the world stability of which it is so indispensable a part .
at home , we must reject the mistaken notion -- a notion that has dominated too much of the public dialogue for too long -- that ever bigger government is the answer to every problem .
we have learned only too well that heavy taxation and excessive government spending are not a cure - all .
in too many cases , instead of solving the problems they were aimed at , they have merely placed an ever heavier burden on the shoulders of the american taxpayer , in the form of higher taxes and a higher cost of living .
at the same time they have deceived our people because many of the intended beneficiaries received far less than was promised , thus undermining public faith in the effectiveness of government as a whole .
the time has come for us to draw the line .
the time has come for the responsible leaders of both political parties to take a stand against overgrown government and for the american taxpayer .
we are not , spending the federal government 's money , we are spending the taxpayer 's money , and it must be spent in a way which guarantees his money 's worth and yields the fullest possible benefit to the people being helped .
the answer to many of the domestic problems we face is not higher taxes and more spending .
it is less waste , more results and greater freedom for the individual american to earn a rightful place in his own community -- and for states and localities to address their own needs in their own ways , in the light of their own priorities .
by giving the people and their locally elected leaders a greater voice through changes such as revenue sharing , and by saying `` no '' to excessive federal spending and higher taxes , we can help achieve this goal .
coming messages
the policies which i will outline to the congress in the weeks ahead represent a reaffirmation , not an abdication , of federal responsibility .
they represent a pragmatic rededication to social compassion and national excellence , in place of the combination of good intentions and fuzzy follow - through which too often in the past was thought sufficient .
in the field of economic affairs , our objectives will be to hold down taxes , to continue controlling inflation , to promote economic growth , to increase productivity , to encourage foreign trade , to keep farm income high , to bolster small business , and to promote better labor - management relations .
in the area of natural resources , my recommendations will include programs to preserve and enhance the environment , to advance science and technology , and to assure balanced use of our irreplaceable natural resources .
in developing human resources , i will have recommendations to advance the nation 's health and education , to improve conditions of people in need , to carry forward our increasingly successful attacks on crime , drug abuse and injustice , and to deal with such important areas of special concern as consumer affairs .
we will continue and improve our nation 's efforts to assist those who have served in the armed services in vietnam through better job and training opportunities .
we must do a better job in community development -- in creating more livable communities , in which all of our children can grow up with fuller access to opportunity and greater immunity to the social evils and blights which now plague so many of our towns and cities .
i shall have proposals to help us achieve this .
i shall also deal with our defense and foreign policies , and with our new approaches to the role and structure of government itself .
considered as a whole , this series of messages will be a blueprint for modernizing the concept and the functions of american government to meet the needs of our people .
converting it into reality will require a spirit of cooperation and shared commitment on the part of all branches of the government , for the goals we seek are not those of any single party or faction , they are goals for the betterment of all americans .
as president , i recognize that i cannot do this job alone .
the congress must help , and i pledge to do my part to achieve a constructive working relationship with the congress .
my sincere hope is that the executive and legislative branches can work together in this great undertaking in a positive spirit of mutual respect and cooperation .
working together -- the congress , the president and the people -- i am confident that we can translate these proposals into an action program that can reform and revitalize american government and , even more important , build a better life for all americans .
